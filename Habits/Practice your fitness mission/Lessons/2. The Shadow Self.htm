<p>At first glance, you wouldn't think body image expert <a href="http://iamerinbrown.com/" target="_blank" >Erin Brown</a> has any problems.</p>
<p>Her glossy publicity photos show luxurious blond hair that's bouncin' and behavin'. She looks like a magnificent Goddess of Strength.</p>

<p> </p>
<p>And yet...</p>
<p>In her <a href="https://www.iamerinbrown.info/about/" target="_blank" >blog, speaking, and books</a>, she talks about her struggle with self-criticism and self-destruction, a cycle that started in childhood with shame over her &quot;unlovable&quot; body.</p>
<p>She hates herself.</p>
<p>And she loves herself.</p>
<p>There are two Erins inside her head.</p>
<p>One Erin is Beyoncé-fabulous, a funny and fierce mother bear and powerful athlete, with an infectious laugh and confident stride. The other Erin is sad, alone, scared, ashamed, and hurting.</p>
<p><strong >These two women live </strong><em ><b>together</b></em><strong>.</strong></p>
<p>And that's OK.</p>

<h1 >Our shadow self</h1>
<p>Our &quot;shadow self&quot; is the parts of ourself that we struggle most with accepting. The parts we aren't proud of. The parts we want to get away from.</p>
<p>Ironically, avoiding the shadow does no good.</p>
<p><strong >The less aware of our shadow we are, or the more we pretend it isn't there, the stronger it gets.</strong></p>

<p>It's like the monster in the closet. If we avoid opening the door and checking inside, the monster grows huge in our minds.</p>
<p>If we face that shadow, and open the closet, we discover that the monster is just a pile of laundry. (Sure, the socks are a little smelly, but that's the price of working out!)</p>
<p>Our shadow self eats shame, fear, anxiety, and avoidance. It eats &quot;Wondering and Worrying Chow&quot;.</p>
<p>Conversely, our best self eats creativity, joy, fun, humor, love, and living with purpose.</p>
<p><strong >Whatever we feed, grows. Which self are you feeding?</strong></p>

<h1 >Practice the right path</h1>
<p><strong >Staying positive and focused on goals requires constant reminders.</strong></p>
<p>Every day is full of temptations to make choices that are unhealthy, or disordered according to your personal goals. Living a healthy life takes a daily repeated commitment.</p>

<p> </p>
<p>Feeling confusing temptations and impulses <em >doesn't</em> mean you've &quot;failed&quot; or aren't <em >really</em> a &quot;fit person&quot;. It means you're human.</p>
<p><strong >Every change and every goal takes daily consistent practice.</strong></p>

<h1 >Stay on track with a clear fitness focus</h1>
<p>Your fitness mission statement keeps you on track. It reminds you to cater to the &quot;fit person&quot;.</p>
<p><strong >Every day, you can practice reminding yourself of who you are and what you want.</strong></p>
<p><strong >Who do you want to become? Why are you doing all of this?</strong></p>
