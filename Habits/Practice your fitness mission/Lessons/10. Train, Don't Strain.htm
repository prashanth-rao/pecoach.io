<section id="ember110" >Drive gently. You'll still get to your destination.</h1>
<p><strong >Are you training... or straining?</strong></p>
<p>Straining in exercise means driving your body like a teenager learns to drive a car, alternately slamming the gas and brake pedals.</p>
<p><em >Vroom.</em> Full speed ahead on killer workouts! Max effort each time! Add another hour of cardio!</p>
<p><em >Errrt!</em> Get hurt. Get sick. Feel discouraged.</p>
<p><em >Vroom.</em> Cut calories down more! Weigh and measure everything!</p>
<p><em >Errrt!</em> Lose control. Feel even more discouraged.</p>
<p>If that could be you, take a moment and ask yourself:</p>
<p><strong >What am I trying to do here?</strong></p>
<ul type=disc >
<li >Get leaner?</li>
<li >Get fitter?</li>
<li >Get healthier?</li>
<li >Have some fun along the way?</li>
</ul>
<p><strong >Do your actions </strong><em ><b>truly</b></em><strong> match your goals?</strong></p>
<p>If you're crushing yourself in the gym, trotting for hours on the treadmill, and/or severely restricting/over-thinking your food intake...</p>
<p>How have your familiar fitness habits been working for you? Are they getting you closer to the results that you want?</p>
<p>Is gas-and-brake getting you where you want to be?</p>

<h1 >The cardio fix</h1>
<p>Strenuous exercise releases endorphins. Endorphins are chemicals that make us feel good.</p>
<p>For most people, the endorphin release helps them sail out of the gym on a high note. It's a nice added bonus.</p>
<p>For some people, endorphins also become a &quot;hit&quot; that they seek. Pushing their bodies to the limit and working hard becomes like a drug.</p>
</section>
<section id="ember112" >
<p>And for some people, exercise (along with cutting calories) can make them feel in control—of bodies and lives.</p>
<p>So, naturally, in both cases, we do more exercise. Or cut calories more. It seems logical, after all.</p>
<p>Except eventually... this approach stops working.</p>
<p>As one previous client describes:</p>
<p><em >I ran 7 marathons over the course of about 10 years, each time hoping that this training round would be the one that got me thinner.</em></p>
<p><em >My end motivation was burning calories. My currency, my value, was calories. Not enjoyment, or muscle stimulation, or increased mobility, or stress reduction. I was exercising for one thing only: Calories.</em></p>
<p><em >But </em><strong ><i>the harder I worked, the more frustrated I got</i></strong><em>. Which I used to propel myself harder, over more miles.</em></p>
<p><em >And I got heavier! The more I trained, adding second sessions each day, the hungrier I was.</em></p>
<p><em >It was a massive battle against appetite, all day long. I never got thinner. Sometimes I gained. I got stressed out, cold after cold after random infection, and was increasingly unhappy with myself.</em></p>
<p><em >For me, what I needed to do to finally drop those last 5–10 pounds wasn't exercise for 1–2 hours a day. It was to go harder for </em><strong ><i>shorter</i></strong><em> periods of time, and give myself enough downtime to recover. Sure, I didn't burn 500–1000 calories a day anymore, but I could eat like a human being, not a crazed animal always on the hunt for food.</em></p>
<p><em >It became so much easier to achieve a slight energy deficit when my body felt more at-ease, less pushed to the limits all the time. And the increased intensity gave my body the stimulus to respond differently. Muscles stayed and got stronger. Fat shrunk away.</em></p>
<p><strong ><i>Reducing my volume of exercise, and changing the way I did it, is what finally got me leaner.</i></strong></p>

<h1 >Training without straining</h1>
<p>Here are some tips to keep you happily training, without the strain.</p>
</section>
<section id="ember115" >
<p><strong >Understand that sometimes, </strong><em ><b>more</b></em><strong> isn't better... better is better.</strong></p>
<p>Past a certain point, more and more exercise, combined with fewer and fewer calories, stops working, especially if you're already relatively fit, and already in a healthy weight range.</p>
<p><strong >Focus your energy.</strong></p>
<p>Be a laser beam, not a scattergun. Pour your energy into doing your absolute best at the few things that truly matter.</p>
<p><strong >Make recovery—what you do between workouts—just as important as training.</strong></p>
<p>Getting stronger and leaner requires balancing stress and your total allostatic load (the cumulative total of all the stuff in your life that causes physical, mental, and/or emotional stress). If you're training hard but under-recovering, you won't see as many benefits.</p>
<p><strong >Listen to your body.</strong></p>
<p>Use a mind-body scan to observe and read your body cues.</p>
<p><strong >Mix it up.</strong></p>
<p>There's a time for tough workouts and a time for taking it easy. There's a time for long runs, and there's a time for throwing a Frisbee around. Look at your workout journal and see whether you can mix things up.</p>
<p><strong >Remember the purpose of your coaching journey.</strong></p>
<p>Stay focused on what is truly important, meaningful, and valuable to you about this process. For example, what does deep health look like for you?</p>
<p><strong >Most of the time, just tap the gas or brake pedal... gently.</strong></p>
<p>Put in a good effort, kick some butt, then relax.</p>
<p><strong >Have fun.</strong></p>
<p>Play. Goof around. Do activities that bring you joy.</p>
