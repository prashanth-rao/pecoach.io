<section id="ember109" >Take the first steps to fitness independence by creating a mission statement.</h1> 
<p><strong >Why a mission statement?</strong></p> 
<p>A mission statement is a clear, simple statement of intent.</p> 
<p>It's what you want to do. What you want to&nbsp;<em >live</em>. What will guide your food, fitness, and wellness choices. Every day.</p> 
<p>With that self-declared statement, you're not following some external &quot;rules&quot; made by someone else.</p> 
<p><strong >Instead, you're making yourself accountable to&nbsp;</strong><em ><b>you</b></em><strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;</strong><em ><b>your</b></em><strong>&nbsp;body. You're the boss, and you have to report to you.</strong></p> 
</section>
<section id="ember110" > 
<h1 >One step at a time</h1> 
<p><strong >Take your time.</strong></p> 
<p>This process can take you an hour, a day, two weeks, or your whole life.</p> 
<p>So don't rush it. Don't feel you have to &quot;get it&quot; all at once.</p> 
<p><strong >Be open to change.</strong></p> 
<p>A mission statement isn't forever. You can always change your mind as you change, and as your life changes.</p> 
<p><strong >Just give the questions some thought.</strong></p> 
<p>Play the self-discovery game at your own pace.</p> 
<p>That's all.</p> 
</section>
<section id="ember111" > 
<h1 >How do I make a fitness mission statement?</h1> 
<p><strong >Step 1: Start getting curious about yourself.</strong></p> 
<p>Ask yourself some questions.</p> 
<p>Such as:</p> 
<ul type=disc > 
<li >Who am I? (And who have I become?)</li> 
<li >Who do I want to be? Why?</li> 
<li >What do I stand for? Why?</li> 
<li >What is meaningful and important to me?</li> 
<li >Where do I want to go? What fitness, nutrition, and/or health behaviors will get me there?</li> 
<li >How will I know if I'm making progress?</li> 
<li >What do I truly enjoy?</li> 
<li >If I had total control of my own health, fitness, and/or nutrition path, what would that look like?</li> 
</ul> 
<p>Writing the answers to these questions on Post-it notes or a whiteboard can help you think it through.</p> 
<p>If you like, ask someone you know what&nbsp;<em >they</em>&nbsp;think you stand for or want. That's often a fascinating conversation.</p> 
</section>
<section id="ember112" > 
<p><strong >Step 2: Look for the themes that re-appear.</strong></p> 
<p>If you consider all your answers together, what are some of the common ideas that start to emerge?</p> 
<p>For instance:</p> 
<ul type=disc > 
<li >Being a parent is important to me.</li> 
<li >My job is important to me.</li> 
<li >Helping other people is important to me.</li> 
<li >I want to excel. I want to be the best.</li> 
<li >I like winning.</li> 
<li >I like learning.</li> 
<li >I like having fun.</li> 
</ul> 
</section>
<section id="ember113" > 
<p><strong >Step 3: See if you can capture the essence.</strong></p> 
<p>Try to capture the who, what, why, where, and how in a few simple, very clear sentences that relate to your health, fitness, and nutrition.</p> 
<p><em >I am a mother, wife, and doctor. I care for other people, and help them heal. Choosing to keep my body healthy—and sharing my knowledge and experience with others—ensures that I live my values, foster integrity, and serve as an example to my family and clients.</em></p> 
<p><em >I am dedicated to living my life creatively and joyfully, and to learning new things. I eat well, and mindfully, because it feels good. I will choose activities that are fun and teach me skills. I will try at least one new sport or activity every six months.</em></p> 
<p><em >I'm driven to be the best. I never met a challenge I didn't chew up. My nutrition and training fuels my pursuit of excellence.</em></p> 
<p>This statement should somehow give you an idea of who you are, what your health, nutrition, and/or fitness means to you, and how you could live those ideals in your daily life.</p> 
<p><strong >Don't worry if you can't get this all at once. Practice getting started.</strong></p>
