<section id="ember111" >Are you giving your power away to something outside yourself?</h1>
<p>Remember the Disney movie <em >Dumbo</em>? When Dumbo the elephant receives a &quot;magic feather&quot; that allows him to fly?</p>
<p>Dumbo can <em >already</em> fly. The feather is just a plain old feather.</p>
<p>Dumbo's feather is a talisman that allows him to believe in himself. In a sense, he &quot;outsourced&quot; self-confidence to the feather.</p>
<p>Eventually, of course, Dumbo realizes he can fly all on his own.</p>
<p>This story reminds us of the importance of internal motivation—the power that comes from believing in what we're capable of. Not giving our power to something outside ourselves.</p>
<p>One way we can see what we're really capable of is to practice taking away our &quot;Dumbo's feather&quot;.</p>

<h1 >What's your Dumbo's feather?</h1>
<p>When it comes to fitness and nutrition, people have all kinds of magic feathers.</p>
<p>Such as:</p>
<ul type=disc >
<li >a particular mealtime ritual</li>
<li >a particular combination of macronutrients</li>
<li >a particular range of foods</li>
<li >a particular time of day to exercise</li>
<li >a particular type of exercise</li>
</ul>
<p>For example:</p>
<p>Some people will swear that running 5 miles a day is the <em >only</em> thing that keeps them lean.</p>
<p>Or that they have to do a triathlon—otherwise it means they aren't <em >really</em> &quot;an athlete&quot;.</p>
<p>Some people shudder at the thought of a meal without meat, while other people shudder at the thought of a meal <em >with</em> meat.</p>
<p>Some people plan their menus with calculators and spreadsheets and food scales. Other people freak out when a number touches their food. (Generally, we'd say that having too many numbers lying around the kitchen is a public health hazard.)</p>
<p>Some people's magic feather is a scale weight, or a piece of clothing. If they stay that scale weight, or fit into that piece of clothing, it means they are officially &quot;lean&quot;. (And if they don't... oy. The wailing.)</p>
<p><strong >Notice what magic feathers have in common?</strong></p>
<p>1. They're all-or-nothing—either you have them or you don't.</p>
<p>2. They're a collection of rules and &quot;shoulds&quot;.</p>
<p>3. They come from <em >outside</em> of you.</p>
<p>4. They give <em >something else that isn't you</em> power over your behaviors and thoughts.</p>

<h1 >It's not heavy, it's my feather</h1>
<p>You may, in fact, have settled into a good routine that works for you and your body. You may indeed have hit the sweet spot.</p>
<p>Alternatively, if you're feeling stagnant, it's also possible that you may also be clutching the feather a little too tightly. Relying on it a little too much.</p>
<p>Feel how much tension that inspires, when you squeeze that feather in a white-knuckle grip.</p>
<p>How do your routines make you feel?</p>
<p>Does grasping to routines make you anxious, exhausted, or afraid?</p>
</section>
<section id="ember114" >
<h1 >Do you want to let the feather go?</h1>
<p><strong >If you're feeling like the feather's no longer serving you, consider letting it go.</strong></p>
<p><strong >Have you gotten to a place that you're strong enough to go without it?</strong></p>
<p><strong >Maybe test it.</strong></p>
<p><strong >Or</strong>, if you love that feather, hang on to it. But relax your fingers. Hold the feather gently.</p>
