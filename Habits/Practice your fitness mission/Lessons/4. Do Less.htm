<h1 >Do more by doing less.</h1>
<p>We live in a culture that often values doing <em>more</em>, and having <em>more</em>.</p>
<p>There are other options for how to live. You might want to consider doing <em>less</em>.</p>
<p>Maybe, in the end, when you do less, you might actually <em>end up with more</em>.</p>
<ul type=disc>
<li >More joy</li>
<li >More satisfaction</li>
<li >More focus</li>
<li >More health</li>
<li >More wisdom</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Doing less allows us to focus on what truly matters, and do those things </strong><em><b>better</b></em><strong>.</strong></p>
<p>It's not easy.</p>
<p>Busy-ness can feel comfortable. Slowing down can feel... kinda lazy, maybe. Or wrong. Or like we're missing something.</p>
<p>But often, the busy-ness can be a mask for deeper fears. Fears like that <em>we're not enough as we are</em>. If we just keep running, we'll get <em>somewhere</em>... because &quot;here&quot; isn't enough.</p>
<p>Actually... <strong>If you're living in accordance with your deeper values, you are </strong><em><b>already</b></em><strong> doing enough. </strong><em><b>You are already</b></em><strong> enough.</strong></p>
<p>Is that true for you?</p>

<h1 >Prioritize and focus</h1>
<p>It's easy to get freaked out and overwhelmed by too many competing demands on your time.</p>
<p>Sit down and make a list of all the things you think you have to do—and then systematically decide <em>not</em> to do some of them. Make your decision based on your priorities and values. Having a clear fitness mission statement makes this type of prioritization easy.</p>
<p>For each task, ask yourself:</p>
<p><strong>Does this fit into what is </strong><em><b>truly</b></em><strong> important and meaningful to me?</strong></p>
<ul type=disc>
<li ><strong>If not</strong>, either put it on a list for later, ask for help, delegate the job to somebody else, or let it go completely—without guilt.</li>
<li ><strong>If yes</strong>, commit to focusing on each task or obligation with your full attention. It'll get done more quickly, plus you'll be more focused and more effective.</li>
</ul>
<h1 >Live your mission statement... and enjoy</h1>
<p>Take a deep breath.</p>
<p>Today, <strong>practice doing less, and enjoying more</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Choose your activities and obligations carefully—and do only what feels meaningful and important to you.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Notice what happens.</strong> Observe your sense of time. Your mood. How your body feels. Record your thoughts in the notes below.</p>
