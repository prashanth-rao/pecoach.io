<p>Coach's Notes:&nbsp;Scaling back expectations and task load in order to succeed. Focusing on essentials.</p> 
<form> 
<h1 >Do more by doing less.</h1> 
<p>We live in a culture that often values doing&nbsp;<em>more</em>, and having&nbsp;<em>more</em>.</p> 
<p>There are other options for how to live. You might want to consider doing&nbsp;<em>less</em>.</p> 
<p>Maybe, in the end, when you do less, you might actually&nbsp;<em>end up with more</em>.</p> 
<ul type=disc> 
<li >More joy</li> 
<li >More satisfaction</li> 
<li >More focus</li> 
<li >More health</li> 
<li >More wisdom</li> 
</ul> 
<p><strong>Doing less allows us to focus on what truly matters, and do those things&nbsp;</strong><em><b>better</b></em><strong>.</strong></p> 
<p>It's not easy.</p> 
<p>Busy-ness can feel comfortable. Slowing down can feel... kinda lazy, maybe. Or wrong. Or like we're missing something.</p> 
<p>But often, the busy-ness can be a mask for deeper fears. Fears like that&nbsp;<em>we're not enough as we are</em>. If we just keep running, we'll get&nbsp;<em>somewhere</em>... because &quot;here&quot; isn't enough.</p> 
<p>Actually...&nbsp;<strong>If you're living in accordance with your deeper values, you are&nbsp;</strong><em><b>already</b></em><strong>&nbsp;doing enough.&nbsp;</strong><em><b>You are already</b></em><strong>&nbsp;enough.</strong></p> 
<p>Is that true for you?</p>

<h1 >Prioritize and focus</h1> 
<p>It's easy to get freaked out and overwhelmed by too many competing demands on your time.</p> 
<p>Sit down and make a list of all the things you think you have to do—and then systematically decide&nbsp;<em>not</em>&nbsp;to do some of them. Make your decision based on your priorities and values. Having a clear fitness mission statement makes this type of prioritization easy.</p> 
<p>For each task, ask yourself:</p> 
<p><strong>Does this fit into what is&nbsp;</strong><em><b>truly</b></em><strong>&nbsp;important and meaningful to me?</strong></p> 
<ul type=disc> 
<li ><strong>If not</strong>, either put it on a list for later, ask for help, delegate the job to somebody else, or let it go completely—without guilt.</li> 
<li ><strong>If yes</strong>, commit to focusing on each task or obligation with your full attention. It'll get done more quickly, plus you'll be more focused and more effective.</li> 
</ul> 
<h1 >Live your mission statement... and enjoy</h1> 
<p>Take a deep breath.</p> 
<p>Today,&nbsp;<strong>practice doing less, and enjoying more</strong>.</p> 
<p><strong>Choose your activities and obligations carefully—and do only what feels meaningful and important to you.</strong></p> 
<p><strong>Notice what happens.</strong>&nbsp;Observe your sense of time. Your mood. How your body feels. Record your thoughts in the notes below.</p>
