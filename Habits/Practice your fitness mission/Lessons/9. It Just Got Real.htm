<p>There is, however, a lot of well-meaning advice out there that can make your life suck.</p> 
<p>Chief among them is &quot;Do what you feel you&nbsp;<em >should</em>&nbsp;do, because some imaginary 'everyone else' is doing it.&quot;</p> 
<p>As writer Chris Guillebeau suggests, satirically, in his guide&nbsp;<a href="http://chrisguillebeau.com/3x5/how-to-be-unremarkably-average" target="_blank" >How To Be Unremarkably Average</a>:</p> 
<p><em >Accept what people tell you at face value. Surround yourself with people who think like you.</em></p> 
<p><em >Don't stand out. Stay close to home. Get a normal job. Do things the way everyone else does, because there has to be a method to the madness...</em></p> 
<p><em >Jump through hoops. Check off boxes...</em></p> 
<p><em >Wherever you go, make absolutely sure that you will be safe and comfortable...</em></p> 
<p><em >Work at a job you don't like for the majority of your professional life...</em></p> 
<p><em >Put the blame on someone else when things go wrong. Never take responsibility for anything.</em></p> 
<p><em >When you fail at something, resolve to never try again.</em></p> 
<p>Dang.</p> 
<p>Forget that plan. That's 10 pounds of poop in a five-pound bag.</p>

<h1 >How to be awesome</h1> 
<p><strong >Find someone who is doing the &quot;thing&quot; that you want to be doing in life.</strong></p> 
<p>Someone who is—right now—living the dream.</p> 
<p><strong >Learn about how that person does what they do.</strong></p> 
<p>Spend some time with them, if you can. Interview them. Exchange an email or two. Or just simply observe their process.</p> 
<p><strong >De-mystify the hero.</strong></p> 
<p>Humanize the person who seems to be &quot;better&quot; than you, because they're successful at something you've always wanted to try or do. Or be.</p> 
<p><strong >Instead, learn how they did what they did.</strong></p> 
<p>It's probably not magic.</p> 
<p>How could you imitate their process or behaviors? Even just a little bit?</p> 
<p>How could you get &quot;there&quot; from &quot;here&quot;?</p> 
</section>
<section id="ember118" ><figure > 
<div class='figure'><img src='D:\PE\Procoach\Nutrition\Resource\img\57137330-dc7d-4caa-bdad-ce1d8514ce7e.png' width=100%></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Don't immediately dismiss things as impossible or &quot;not for me&quot;. Accept whatever information and insight comes your way.</p> 
<p><strong >Look at the small daily actions that led your &quot;dream person&quot; to live the life they currently live.</strong></p> 
<p>What are their habits? What were their tiny &quot;little bit better&quot; steps that got them there?</p> 
</section>
<section id="ember120" > 
<h1 >How could you make it happen?</h1> 
<p>Once you gather the information, ask yourself:&nbsp;<em >If I absolutely&nbsp;</em><strong ><i>had</i></strong><em>&nbsp;to do this thing... how could I do it?</em></p> 
<p><strong >If you had no choice but to&nbsp;</strong><em ><b>follow your dream...</b></em><strong>&nbsp;how would you make it happen?</strong></p> 
<p>What do your role models say?</p> 
<p>How could you imitate what they do?</p> 
<p>How are they &quot;average people&quot; just like you… who've simply made different choices?</p> 
<p>How could you help yourself make those choices in the future?</p> 
</section>
<section id="ember121" > 
<h1 >Enjoy the excitement. Anything is possible.</h1> 
<p>Does thinking about it make your heart jump? Do you feel a bit woozy or lightheaded? Kinda want to barf a little, but in a good way?</p> 
<p>Are you wearing a dumb grin on your face without even realizing it?</p> 
<p>A world of adventures lie before you. Perhaps closer than you imagined.</p> 
<p><strong >Think about how your fitness mission aligns with your dreams.</strong></p> 
<p>Can you bring your mission and dreams together? If so, how?</p>
