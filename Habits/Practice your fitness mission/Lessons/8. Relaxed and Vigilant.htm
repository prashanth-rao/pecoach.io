<p>Coach's Notes:&nbsp;Finding a middle path between hyper-vigilance and getting too complacent.</p> 
<form > 
<h1 >
<section id="ember117" >Are you too vigilant or too relaxed in your practices? Find the middle path.</h1> 
<p>After you've been practicing every day for a long time, and you have some solid routines in place, you can relax a bit. Trust your instincts and your systems. Enjoy the sense of accomplishment. Bask in the satisfaction.</p> 
<p>Also, try not to get too comfortable.</p> 
<p>When some people get their practices down, they relax a bit too much. It can be easy to let systems slide into complacency, and lose track of what you had been enjoying.</p>

<p><strong >Other people swing the other way, into hyper-vigilance.</strong></p> 
<p>They surround themselves with external structures and motivators who help them keep an eye on things. They monitor and judge themselves constantly.</p> 
<p>If they step out of line, they bark orders to themselves like a jail guard.</p>

<section id="ember120" > 
<h1 >Finding the balance</h1> 
<p><strong >The ideal is a balanced middle path.</strong></p> 
<p>We need to relax and trust ourselves. And also be vigilant, and get external support.</p> 
<p>For instance:</p> 
<ul type=disc > 
<li >We can harness respect with both quiet humility (inside) and get-er-dun confidence (outside).</li> 
<li >We can &quot;control&quot; our bodies with both inner contentment (inside) and regular routines (outside).</li> 
<li >We can follow our chosen path with both faith in self (inside) and faith in others (outside).</li> 
</ul> 
<p>Most of the time, we need both.</p> 
<p>We need to walk the middle path between these two, enjoying the best features of each while avoiding the pitfalls and potholes. It's tricky ground.</p>

<h1 >The good, the bad, and the healthy</h1> 
<p>Neither relaxation nor vigilance is inherently good or bad. They're adaptable, to be used productively for the right applications. Below is a chart showing the better and worse sides of both relaxation and vigilance.</p> 
<p>Notice how many of the positive elements of both are driven by your own values and &quot;best self&quot;.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong >How can you take the best elements of these, and make them work for&nbsp;</strong><em ><b>you</b></em><strong>?</strong></p> 
<h1 >Start by knowing yourself and what you need.</h1> 
<p><strong >What is your &quot;best self&quot;?</strong></p> 
<p><strong >What do you need in order to be your &quot;best self&quot;?</strong></p> 
<p><strong >What are your strengths?</strong></p> 
<p>If you were your own best friend... or your own coach... what would you observe about yourself (in a loving, non-judgmental, and observant way)? How would your friend or coach help nudge you towards your best self?</p> 
<p>Where is your middle ground?</p> 
<p>What are your extremes?</p> 
<p>How can you keep yourself walking that middle path?</p> 
<p>You don't need to swing wildly from extreme to extreme. Instead, nudge yourself back on the middle road when necessary. Apply a little more or less relaxation or vigilance, as needed.</p>
