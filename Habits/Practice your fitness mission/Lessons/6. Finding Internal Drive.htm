<p>At some point in everyone's journey, the high fives die down.</p>
<p>Let them.</p>
<p>Yes, we want to encourage each other. To celebrate our successes. Brag a bit about our new accomplishments.</p>
<p>Then, <strong >at some point we have to turn our backs to the cheering crowd, and find acknowledgement from within.</strong></p>
<p>From internal cheerleaders.</p>
<p><strong >Tune in to your own instinct, and your own internal reward systems.</strong></p>
<p>Find your &quot;inner carrot&quot; of meaningful motivation rather than chasing someone else's approval.</p>

<p>It may be uncomfortable. The outcome of this practice is a confidence that is authentic to who you are—not a confidence that depends on what others are saying.</p>
<p>That's freedom.</p>
<p>First: Some honesty.</p>

<h1 >Revise and resubmit</h1>
<p>If you've ever published a paper in an academic or scientific journal, you'll know these three words: &quot;revise and resubmit&quot;.</p>

<section id="ember122" >
<div class='figure'><img src='https://prashanth-rao.github.io/pecoach.io/Resource/img/df5571e8-2639-4da8-8039-dd168af359fb.jpg' width=100%></div>

<p>It means edit your work substantially, fix a bunch of stuff, then hand it back in—and maybe this time the editors and reviewers won't scribble all over it with red corrective marker.</p>
<p>Many writers dread these three words. They think it means their genius has gone unnoticed. Usually, all it means is that the paper needs a bit more work. Sometimes just a little bit of rewriting to take out the speling erurs. That's it.</p>
<p>Once the grumpy author gets over their snit fit, they might realize that the reviewers were right.</p>
<p><strong >Today, double check with yourself to see whether your mission statement needs to be revised and resubmitted.</strong></p>

<section id="ember124" >
<h1 >Use your mind-body scan</h1>
<p>A mind-body scan can help. Use it to tune in to your internal cues.</p>
<p>How has your coaching journey been working for you? Do your goals, values, and priorities still resonate strongly with you?</p>
<p><strong >Check with your body.</strong></p>
<p>Does your mission statement feel right? Does it feel active and energizing? Or depleting and empty?</p>
<p><strong >Check with your emotions.</strong></p>
<p>Does it make you feel excited? Anxious? Obligated? Happy? Existentially itchy?</p>
<p><strong >Check with your thoughts.</strong></p>
<p>Are you over-thinking your mission statement? Fretting about details? Or is it all falling into place?</p>
<p>What do your body, emotions, and thoughts tell you about how well this mission statement works for you, your body, and your values?</p>
<p>Does it fit?</p>
</section>
<section id="ember125" >
<h1 >Revise, resubmit and respond</h1>
<p>If you need to, streamline and simplify that mission statement. Bring it alongside so that you are sailing in the same direction.</p>
<p>It's OK if you need to negotiate your mission statement a little bit, rewrite it completely if you want. You haven't ordered it printed on business cards yet. It's still a work in progress.</p>
<p>Most importantly, <strong >tune in and follow your internal compass. This mission statement is about you, your body, and what's important to you.</strong></p>
