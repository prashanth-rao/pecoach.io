<h1 >Look ahead.</h1>
<p><strong >Crafting a healthy body, and deep health, is about </strong><em ><b>how you live</b></em><strong>. Staying true to yourself. Being accountable to </strong><em ><b>your</b></em><strong> body.</strong></p>
<p>Sustainable body transformation, and deep health, isn't a diet or temporary thing with an end date.</p>
<p>Sure, once you've lost the fat you wanted to lose, you'll transition into maintenance. You might set other fitness goals, and shift strategies. Hopefully, you'll get excited about all the possibilities that your fit new body offers you.</p>
<p><strong >In reality, there's no &quot;after&quot;. There's just... your life.</strong></p>

<h1 >The rewards of successful deliberate change</h1>
<p>The goal of coaching through a body transformation program is to return you to the wild with fresh eyes and re-invigorated spirit.</p>
<p>...so you can <em ><b>live</b></em><strong> your healthy values and choices in ways that work for </strong><em ><b>you</b></em>... not blindly follow what &quot;experts&quot; say.</p>
<p>...so you can <strong >stay honest and ask, &quot;</strong><em ><b>How's that working for me</b></em><strong>?&quot;</strong>... not to get stuck on rigid, abstract &quot;rules&quot; and &quot;shoulds&quot;.</p>
<p>...so you can <em ><b>use</b></em><strong> and </strong><em ><b>enjoy</b></em><strong> your body</strong>—to have adventures, get out in the bigger world, and do fun stuff... not to shrink your universe to calories and carb grams and minutes of intervals.</p>
<p>...so you can <strong >use your health and new knowledge to help other people</strong>... not to become a self-involved, body-obsessed bellybutton-voyeur.</p>
<p>...so you can <strong >feel joy, happiness, and creativity</strong>... not anxiety, fear, and focused on &quot;flaws&quot;.</p>
<p>...so you can <strong >build </strong><em ><b>your</b></em><strong> best self while accepting your shadow self</strong>—but not feeding the dark side.</p>
<p>...so you can <strong >find and develop your strengths</strong>... not to obsess over your &quot;weaknesses&quot;.</p>
<p>So that ultimately you can enjoy <strong >deep health</strong>—the alignment of body, mind, spirit, and life.</p>

<p>Focus on the journey—instead of the outcome—and the positive side-effects will soon follow.</p>
