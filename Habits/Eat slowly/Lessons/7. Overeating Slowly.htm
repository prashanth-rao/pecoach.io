<h1 align=center >Overeating Slowly</h1> 
<h2 align=center >Go slow, no shame, to check-in. What's really going on while you're overeating?</h2> 
<p>Coach's Notes:&nbsp;An &quot;Opposite Day&quot; exercise: If you over-eat, you have our &quot;permission&quot;... but do it slowly. This takes away the &quot;rebellion&quot; and &quot;forbidden-ness&quot; of over-eating, leaving only mindfulness and the awareness that inevitably comes from slowing down.</p>

<h1 >
<section id="ember107" >This is &quot;permission&quot; to overeat... for now... with a catch.</h1> 
<p>Simple change can lead to big results. Especially the foundational simple things like slowing down, relaxing, and paying attention.</p> 
<p>Whether it's …</p> 
<ul type=disc > 
<li >garden-variety overeating (as in &quot;Ma! No more pasta! OK, maybe a little&quot;);</li> 
<li >distracted eating (&quot;Oops! Did I finish that entire bag of chips while watching Breaking Bad?&quot;);</li> 
<li >binge eating (&quot;I totally lost control&quot;),</li> 
</ul> 
<p>It's common to struggle with their food choices sometimes. It's normal.</p> 
<p><strong >Today, if you overeat, try a new practice: Instead of stressing on it, do it, and do it&nbsp;</strong><em ><b>slowly</b></em><strong>.</strong></p>

<section id="ember108" > 
<h1 >More speed, less control</h1> 
<p>Ever notice what overeating episodes and/or poor food choices tend to have in common?</p> 
<p>Speed.</p> 
<p>If you've ever been through a classic binge, you know the feeling. It's like going on autopilot.</p> 
<p>Hand, mouth, hand, mouth, hand, mouth. Picking up speed as you go, faster and faster and faster. Once you get serious momentum, it feels almost impossible to stop.</p> 
<p><strong >Right now, if you're struggling with binge eating, don't try to stop it.</strong></p> 
<p>Instead, notice how the binge eating does something important and valuable for you. Right now, overeating solves a problem for you (even if it creates other problems).</p> 
<p>If you're in the throes of a compulsive eating episode, eat as much as you need to—<em >and whatever types of foods you want—in order to cope with the feelings you're experiencing.</em></p> 
<p>Eat until you're done.</p> 
<p><strong >The only catch is that you&nbsp;</strong><em ><b>eat slowly</b></em><strong>. Instead of &quot;don't overeat&quot;, overeat slowly, and notice.</strong></p> 
</section>
<section id="ember109" > 
<h1 >Is that irresponsible?</h1> 
<p>If you're like many people who have grappled with overeating, you've tried to &quot;just stop&quot;.</p> 
<p>You've tried to talk yourself out of it. You've felt guilty, regretful, and ashamed.</p> 
<p>Did it work?</p> 
<p>...</p> 
<p>Maybe ... it could be more&nbsp;<strong >&quot;responsible&quot; and productive to learn to&nbsp;</strong><em ><b>be present</b></em><strong>&nbsp;with what you're eating and feeling, rather than checking out.</strong></p> 
<p>You can practice that by accepting your body's coping behavior, slowing down for it, and listening.</p>
