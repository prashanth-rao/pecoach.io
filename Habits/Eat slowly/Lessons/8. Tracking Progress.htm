<section id="ember113" >There are a lot of ways to measure progress. Some you may not have thought of yet.</h1> 
<p><strong >Imagine you've already changed.</strong></p> 
<p>Imagine that tonight, as you sleep, your world magically changes.</p> 
<p><strong >You wake up tomorrow morning with everything you've ever wanted.</strong></p> 
<p>Every life change, every goal, everything you've ever striven for has been achieved.</p> 
<p>You don't how know this wondrous transformation occurred—you were asleep, after all—but you know it's perfect.</p> 
<p>You open your eyes, yawn, and look around.</p> 
<p>If this happened to you ....</p> 
<p><strong >What will have changed for you and your life? Which things are different?</strong></p>

<section id="ember114" > 
<h1 >What is &quot;progress&quot;?</h1> 
<p>If you're going somewhere, how will you know when you get there?</p> 
<p>Along the way, how do you know that you're on track to your destination?</p> 
<p>Here are three common and important measures of progress:</p> 
<ul type=disc > 
<li ><strong >Body composition</strong>: How much lean mass and body fat do you have?</li> 
<li ><strong >Health</strong>: Are your body systems operating well?</li> 
<li ><strong >Thinking and decision-making</strong>: Do you feel clear-headed, engaged, and focused?</li> 
<li ><strong >Fitness and athletic performance</strong>: How do you perform in the gym or in your chosen activities?</li> 
</ul> 
<p>In total:&nbsp;<strong >How do you look, feel, and perform?</strong></p> 
<p>Using the three measures of progress above, you might also improve:</p> 
<ul type=disc > 
<li >strength</li> 
<li >your blood profile (e.g., triglycerides, cholesterol)</li> 
<li >speed</li> 
<li >work capacity</li> 
<li >recovery</li> 
<li >immune system</li> 
</ul> 
<p>You're here for your own reasons.</p> 
<p><strong >Your coaching journey — and your body — is unique.</strong></p> 
<p>What counts as &quot;progress&quot; to you will be different than what determines &quot;progress&quot; for someone else.</p> 
</section>
<section id="ember115" > 
<h1 >Track other kinds of progress</h1> 
<p>It's hard to see &quot;progress&quot; in daily life because you see yourself every day. It's hard to see contrast when you're in it.</p> 
<p>Some types of progress are easier to measure:</p> 
<ul type=disc > 
<li >Can you lift 10 pounds more today than you could last month?</li> 
<li >Can you run 5 minutes longer than you could last week?</li> 
<li >Have you been virus-free this year—after getting 6 colds last year?</li> 
<li >Has your LDL (&quot;bad&quot;) cholesterol gone down from your last blood test?</li> 
</ul> 
<p>These are &quot;hard facts&quot;.</p> 
<p>Other types of progress are intangible. Some may be surprising.</p> 
<p>For instance, subjective measures like,</p> 
<ul type=disc > 
<li >&quot;I walk tall now.&quot;</li> 
<li >&quot;My posture is better.&quot;</li> 
<li >&quot;I'm so much happier on the inside.&quot;</li> 
<li >&quot;I've become a better parent.&quot;</li> 
<li >&quot;I feel healthy.&quot;</li> 
<li >&quot;I feel confident in my food decisions.&quot;</li> 
<li >&quot;I'm more organized.&quot;</li> 
<li >&quot;I'm stronger...inside and out.&quot;</li> 
<li >&quot;I'm determined.&quot;</li> 
<li >&quot;I'm more focused.&quot;</li> 
</ul> 
<p>These things are less measurable... they're noticed and felt just the same.</p>

<section id="ember116" > 
<h1 >Track what's important to you</h1> 
<p>Ask yourself:</p> 
<p>What will tell me that I am getting better at doing what I want to do?</p> 
<p>How do I know I'm on track to my long-term goals?</p> 
<p>If I get what I want, how will I know?</p> 
</section>
<section id="ember117" > 
<h1 >Look for progress everywhere</h1> 
<p>You never know where progress may lurk. Keep an open mind and hunt for it. Finding these small clues of progress are keys to lasting motivation.</p>
