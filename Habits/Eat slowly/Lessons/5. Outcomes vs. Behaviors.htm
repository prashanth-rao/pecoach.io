<section id="ember122" >Focus on the process, not the product.</h1> 
<p>If you want to make big changes, it will require small, consistent behavior. Stay focused on what you can control: That is, changing daily behavior, rather than worrying about future outcomes.</p> 
</section>
<section id="ember123" > 
<h1 >Behaviors vs. outcomes</h1> 
<p>The world is mostly uncontrollable. Life happens.</p> 
<ul type=disc > 
<li >If you want to sell your house for a good price, you can renovate it and give it a fresh coat of paint. But you can’t control the real estate market.</li> 
<li >If you want to have a nice picnic, you can pack a basket and blanket and plan your route to the park. But you can't control the weather.</li> 
<li >If you want to lose weight, you can eat well and stay active. But you can't control your fat cells.</li> 
</ul> 
<p>You can't make your body lose 20 pounds on command any more than you can make your house worth a certain amount when you sell it.</p> 
<p>In other words,&nbsp;<strong ><i>you can't control the outcome.</i></strong></p> 
<p><strong >But you&nbsp;</strong><em ><b>can</b></em><strong>&nbsp;control the behaviors that&nbsp;</strong><em ><b>lead to the outcome you want</b></em><strong>.</strong></p> 
<p>Outcomes are WHAT you want. But outcomes don't tell you what to do.</p> 
<p>Behaviors are HOW you'll get there. Behavior goals give you an action plan.</p> 
</section>
<section id="ember124" > 
<h1 >Set behavior goals</h1> 
<p>Here are a few examples showing the difference between outcome and behavior goals.</p> 
<p><strong >Outcome goals</strong></p> 
<ul type=disc > 
<li >Run a 5K race in 23 minutes.</li> 
<li >Lose 10 lb.</li> 
<li >Squat 80 lb.</li> 
</ul> 
<p><strong >Behavior goals</strong></p> 
<ul type=disc > 
<li >Run for 20 minutes three times per week for the next month, gradually increasing the duration and speed.</li> 
<li >Practice eating slowly at every meal.</li> 
<li >Show up every day and do coaching practices consistently.</li> 
<li >Start giving piggyback rides regularly, like Helen, who worked up to squatting her kids:</li> 
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong >Behavior goals are a commitment to do a specific set of actions that lead to the outcome you want.</strong></p> 
<p><strong >Behavior goals are also,</strong></p> 
<ul type=disc > 
<li >things you do consistently and regularly;</li> 
<li >small, manageable tasks that are within your control; and</li> 
<li >often things that you can do right now, today or in the near future.</li> 
</ul> 
<p>You can't control the outcome. You can control the behaviors that, when done consistently, will move you in the right direction.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>In the first circle, identify what you want the outcome of your coaching program to be.</p> 
<p>In “this month”, “this week”, and “today”, write what you will do to get to that outcome.</p> 
<p>Notice how what you do right now—and in the near future—contributes to the outcome you seek.</p> 
</section>
<section id="ember130" > 
<h1 >Set yourself up for success</h1> 
<p>Be realistic with what you can do. For now, under-estimate your capacity.</p> 
<p>It's better to start small and succeed than go big and feel like inadequate for &quot;failing&quot;.</p>
