<section id="ember106" >Here's how to get the opposite of what you want.</h1> 
<p>Eating slowly aids digestion, calms nerves, and makes food feel more satisfying.</p> 
<p>That also means losing weight while enjoying life more. Nice.</p> 
<p><strong >So what's wrong with eating fast?</strong></p> 
<p>Below is a cautionary &quot;Opposite Day&quot; tale from Dr. JB, a former skinny guy who wanted to put on as much weight as quickly as possible.</p>

<h1 >How to gain weight as quickly as possible</h1> 
<p><em >By Dr. John Berardi</em></p> 
<p>&quot;When I was a young, dumb, skinny guy I was desperate to put on weight. Of course, I wanted to gain as much muscle as possible. But I wasn't afraid to gain fat, either.</p> 
<p>Really, I just wanted to look and feel huge and powerful.</p> 
<p>So I trained like crazy in the gym. And I did every ridiculous thing I could think of to gain weight, which was no small feat since I was an 18 year old full of hormones and a raging metabolism.</p> 
<p>One strategy my friends and I came up with was based on an idea I learned about in nutrition class.</p> 
<p>My instructor taught us that our &quot;satiety mechanisms&quot; kicked in about 20 minutes after we started a meal.</p> 
<p>No matter how much we ate during the first 20 minutes of starting a meal, we wouldn't feel satisfied or even full until we hit the magical satiety time.</p> 
<p>Of course, in nutrition class, our teacher told us that's why many people overeat: they eat too much during the first 20 minutes, thinking they're not full. Then, 20 minutes later, they feel &quot;overfull&quot; and guilty.</p> 
<p>However, if they'd only slowed down, their bodies' natural satiety mechanisms would have kicked in to put on the brakes. (Remember that: You can and will feel full if you just slow down. The body's natural signals will do the work for you. You don't have to overthink it.)</p> 
<p>Ah-ha! For me and my weight-gain-obsessed friends, speed gobbling became a new eating strategy. We'd try to trick our satiety mechanisms by eating as much food as we could, as fast as we could, before we felt full.&quot;</p> 
<p>&quot;We even went so far as to throw eating parties where all our weightlifting friends would come over to binge. (Yeah, we were cool like that.) We'd put on loud, fast-paced music and speed-eat, trying to pack in a few thousand calories within the first 20 minutes of a meal.</p> 
<p>Sounds ridiculous, I know. But it worked. I gained about 70 pounds in two years.</p> 
<p>Which brings me to the moral: if you're trying to gain weight, eat as much as you can as fast as you can.</p> 
<p>Of course, if you're trying to lose weight, do the opposite.</p> 
<p>Slow down. Enjoy your food. Stay &quot;checked in&quot;. Nibble for the first 20 minutes of your meal until your satiety mechanism kicks in.</p> 
<p>You'll feel more physically and mentally satisfied with less food. Your stomach will thank you.</p> 
<p>Best of all, you'll start to lose weight. (Think of it as practice just in case you get invited to have high tea with the Queen of England.)&quot;</p>
