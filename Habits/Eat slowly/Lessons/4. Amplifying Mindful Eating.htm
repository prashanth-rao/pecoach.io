<h2 align=center >Life is a bowl full of raisins.</h2>

<section id="ember107" >Eat a raisin... really, really, really slowly</h1>
<p>At some point in the next few days, book 15 minutes with no interruptions or distractions to spend with yourself and a special fruit (like raisins, dried cranberries, or other fresh berries).</p>
<p>The particular fruit doesn't matter as much as the practice. The practice is building the skill of slowing down, being careful, thoughtful, and mindful. When you master this skill enough to have it on-demand anytime, it can be applied to any food, meal, relationship, or stressful situation.</p>
<p>Set the fruit out in front of you. Notice …</p>
<ul type=disc >
<li >How is this fruit unique? What details do you notice about the way it looks? What do you like and not like about that?</li>
<li >How does it smell? Like a familiar smell? If yes, can you identify the scent?</li>
<li >When you put the fruit in your mouth without chewing it, how does it feel? How’s the texture?</li>
<li >When you bite into it, what happens? What happens to your taste buds? How does your body respond?</li>
<li >How does it taste? Does the taste change over time as you chew?</li>
</ul>
<p>There's countless details, qualities, and impressions to be noticed with one small piece of fruit. Practice observing carefully.</p>
<p>After doing this exercise, ask yourself:</p>
<p>What did I notice?</p>
<p>What did I experience?</p>
<p>Don't worry—Slow eating doesn't always need to be this in-depth. This is an exaggerated exercise. The purpose is to amplify senses, and be a reminder of <strong >how much more you can experience and enjoy food when you slow down, pay attention, and eat mindfully</strong>.</p>
