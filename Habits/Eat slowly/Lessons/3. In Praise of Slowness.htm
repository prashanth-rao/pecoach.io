<p><strong >When we eat slowly, we feel more satisfied with less food, physiologically and psychologically.</strong></p>
<p>Even better:</p>
<p><strong >The benefits of going slow don't only apply to eating.</strong> Practicing slowing down and paying attention, everything feels more satisfying.</p>

<h1 >In praise of slowness</h1>
<p>It's common to be busy, over-scheduled, and rushed to live faster and faster.</p>
<p>That can explain popular diet mentality—wanting to lose weight immediately! Six-pack abs in six weeks! No, six days!</p>
<p>Bodies struggle to keep up pace with society and diet culture.</p>
<p><strong >Eventually, the strain becomes obvious. You can feel it when you're eating too quickly, inside of living too quickly.</strong></p>
<p>Rapid results don't last. The things most worthwhile in life takes dedication and patience. (Like parenting, relationships, getting a degree, mastering a skill, building a career, etc.)</p>
<p><strong >You can start practicing by slowing down with food.</strong></p>
<p>Eat slowly. Savor your food. Try adding 5 minutes to each meal.</p>
<p>Stick to the program. Be consistent, patient, and persistent. Keep showing up. Day after day. One step at a time.</p>
<p>To get you in the mood, here's a great TED talk from journalist Carl Honore on <a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/carl_honore_praises_slowness" target="_blank" >the value of slower living</a>.</p>

<section id="ember112" >Relax</h1>
<p>Speed and urgency is a common worry. For example, in the coaching program, you might worry ...</p>
<ul type=disc >
<li >If you miss a daily practice or a workout, are you still going to get results fast enough?</li>
<li >Are you learning enough everyday? You might want to read ahead to learn it all right now.</li>
<li >Will travel and work disrupt starting new healthy practices?</li>
<li >Why is that scale not changing? Why are you not losing weight faster?</li>
</ul>
<p>The worries are real. And also, not helpful. Worries don't make progress. Progress is made with consistent action, practice, and slowing down enough to make that happen in any small way possible.</p>
<p>If you don't lose weight quick, that's normal and expected. This is different than a crash diet. This is a plan for long-term sustainable body transformation and deep health.</p>
<p>We're building a foundation of healthy skills for life.</p>
<p><strong >Let yourself be slow and steady.</strong></p>
<p>You'll enjoy the process a lot more. You'll feel much more relaxed. And you'll get better results, too.</p>
