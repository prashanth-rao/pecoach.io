<p> </p>
<p><strong >At one end of the line, write down your earliest memory about food</strong>, such as:</p>
<ul type=disc >
<li >Eating Cheerios with your little brother.</li>
<li >Sitting with your grandmother as she made chapatis.</li>
<li >The smell of chicken roasting at a family gathering.</li>
<li >Your fifth birthday party—mom put candies on your cake!</li>
<li >Breastfeeding—wow, great recall! (Or possibly extra-hippie childhood.)</li>
</ul>
<p>Imagine the scene clearly. (If you can even find a photo of this memory, that's cool—stick it on!)</p>
<p><strong >Going forward from there, add your food memories along the line</strong>. For instance:</p>
<ul type=disc >
<li >Learning to make toast at age eight.</li>
<li >Making Hot Pockets as a hungry teenager.</li>
<li >Working at a fast food joint.</li>
</ul>
<p>And so on.</p>
<p>Take special note of memories that involve:</p>
<ul type=disc >
<li ><strong >emotional associations with food</strong>—sadness, happiness, shame, excitement, etc.</li>
<li ><strong >iconic childhood and/or comfort foods</strong>—marshmallow toasting, abuela’s tostadas, etc.</li>
<li ><strong >personal or social connections with food</strong>—certain recipes reminding you of a loved one, how you ate with a certain friend group, etc.</li>
<li ><strong >particular food behaviors</strong>—eating alone, hiding food, picky eating, etc.</li>
<li ><strong >food victories</strong>—learning to cook something difficult, finally nailing the slow eating, etc.</li>
</ul>

<h1 >Review</h1>
<p>Once you've written down plenty of food memories, review your history.</p>
<p><strong >What does it tell you?</strong></p>
<p><strong >What does it say about you?</strong> About what is important to you? About who you are?</p>
<p><strong >How did you learn your current food behaviors and worldview?</strong></p>
</section>
<section id="ember124" >
<h1 >Look forward</h1>
<p><strong >What does your history tell you about your future?</strong></p>
<p><strong >About who you </strong><em ><b>want</b></em><strong> to be?</strong></p>
<p><strong >About what you might need to change?</strong> Or do more of? (Find the awesome and make it awesomer-er.)</p>
<p><strong >What do you want to remember of yourself six months from now?</strong> A year from now? 10 years from now?</p>

<section id="ember125" >
<h1 >Food doesn't float your boat?</h1>
<p>If writing your food history doesn't seem all that interesting, try writing a timeline with:</p>
<ul type=disc >
<li >your experiences of fitness (i.e. your movement, sport, and fitness memories) or</li>
<li >body image (i.e. your memories of positive or negative body experiences).</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="ember126" >
<h1 >Choose your own adventure</h1>
<p>Now, find the space at the end of your history line. The blank spot. For the yet-to-be-created memories. Choose your own adventure. Your next chapter.</p>
</section>
<section id="ember127" >

<p> </p>
<p>Going forward, think about how your history shapes you… and how you can change your destiny. Start practicing today.</p>
