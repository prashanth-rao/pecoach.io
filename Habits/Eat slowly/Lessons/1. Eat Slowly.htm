<p><strong >Going slow makes everything else possible.</strong></p> 
<p>Eating slowly and mindfully is more important than:</p> 
<ul type=disc > 
<li >what you eat</li> 
<li >when you eat</li> 
<li >where you eat</li> 
<li >who you eat with</li> 
<li >getting anything else &quot;perfect&quot;</li> 
</ul> 
<p>Eating slowly will help you lose weight, enjoy your food, and fight off cravings.</p> 
<p><strong >Yes, it's seriously important.</strong></p> 
<p>If you get off track, feel overwhelmed, or if you catch yourself rushing: don't panic.</p> 
<p>Simply pause.</p> 
<p>Relax.</p> 
<p>Reboot.</p> 
<p>And go back to eating slowly.</p>
