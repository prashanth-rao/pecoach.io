<section id="ember111" >One secret to a lean and healthy body: Paying attention.</h1> 
<p><strong >What's going on right now?</strong></p> 
<p>In this moment,</p> 
<ul type=disc > 
<li >What are you doing?</li> 
<li >What are you thinking?</li> 
<li >How are you feeling?</li> 
<li >What's around you?</li> 
</ul> 
<p>Maybe it's not clear.</p> 
<p>Maybe you're trying to answer an email while listening to music or talking on the phone, or driving (please, no). Maybe you're trying to multi-task and juggle all the demands on your attention all at once.</p> 
<p>The brain is constantly making decisions. Most of them are automatic and unconscious.</p> 
<p>The upside is that we can put some patterns on auto-pilot—like driving, typing, tying shoelaces, and brushing teeth.</p> 
<p>The downside is that we put other patterns on auto-pilot—like mindless snacking, using booze or junk food to de-stress, or grabbing another round of take-out for another rushed lunch break.</p> 
<p><strong >We don't make unhealthy food decisions because we're dumb or lazy.</strong>&nbsp;(If you're still reading this, you're probably smart and working to stay focused on progress.)</p> 
<p><strong >We make unhealthy food decisions because they're&nbsp;</strong><em ><b>automatic</b></em><strong>.</strong>&nbsp;Because we're distracted. Because we're rushing. Automatic choices, minus attention, plus rushed eating, often equals less-healthy outcomes.</p> 
<p>Luckily, there's a simple solution:&nbsp;<strong >Slow down.</strong></p> 
<p>And then:&nbsp;<strong >Notice and name.</strong></p> 
</section>
<section id="ember112" > 
<h1 >Notice and name</h1> 
<p><strong >Noticing means pausing to pay attention.</strong></p> 
<p>What's going on right now? What am I doing?</p> 
<p><strong >Naming means taking an extra moment to describe the situation to yourself.</strong></p> 
<p>Call it out. &quot;Oh, right, I'm feeling rushed, and that means I'm more likely to grab junk.&quot;</p> 
</section>
<section id="ember113" > 
<h1 >How does that help me?</h1> 
<p><strong >Slow down, pausing, and paying attention puts the conscious, executive brain in charge instead of the unconscious, automatic brain.</strong></p> 
<p>We're able to make more informed choices, like picking healthy food.</p> 
<p>We feel more in control of actions—more able to do those behavior goals we've set for ourselves.</p> 
<p>We're calmer. Kinder with ourselves. We notice little things, like the way we're doing an exercise. Or whether we're rushing through a meal.</p> 
<p>We place our attention on our goals, rather than having it pulled. We can focus on moving towards those long-term goals.</p> 
<p>And when we name the situation, we call it out. Hold ourselves accountable, without judgement. Just observation.</p> 
<p><em >Hey, you're doing that thing again.</em></p> 
<p><em >Oops. Right.</em></p> 
<p><em >Noticing that.</em></p> 
<p><em >OK, I'm taking a second to regroup.</em></p> 
<p><em >Back on track.</em></p>

<h1 >Try it</h1> 
<p>What are your patterns?</p> 
<p>What do you &quot;just find yourself&quot; doing?</p> 
<p>What's happening&nbsp;<em >right now</em>?</p> 
<p>What's distracting you—and how can you re-focus on your goals?</p> 
<p>How does that sandwich taste? What's the texture like? How many times can you chew it before you’re stressed about speed?</p>
