<section id="ember172" >How do you get protein when you're on the run?</h1>
<p><strong >Easy: Try a quick and tasty Super Shake.</strong></p>
<p>The Super Shake is a &quot;meal in a glass&quot;: It's a mix of protein and whole foods such as fruits, vegetables, and nuts or seeds.</p>
<p>Super Shakes are a nutritious choice when you need high-quality food but don't have a lot of time. They're a healthier alternative to most popular high-sugar smoothies.</p>

<section id="ember173" >
<h1 >Protein powder</h1>
<p>The main ingredient. Protein powder is a convenient, portable, relatively non-perishable supplement source of protein. (And it tastes better in a Super Shake than many other high-protein foods. Like, say, tuna.)</p>
<p>No one needs to eat protein powder to be healthy. If you can get enough protein for your goals from whole sources, whole sources are always superior to supplements.</p>
<p>If you can tolerate dairy, cottage cheese or Greek yogurt also work for making high-protein shakes.</p>
<h1 >What to look for</h1>
<p>Stick to the basics.</p>
<ul type=disc >
<li >Look for powders without too many excess ingredients in them, e.g., sugar, coloring, artificial flavors, and other &quot;sports supplements&quot;. The main purpose of the powder is the protein source. Usually fewer ingredients is a sign of a higher-quality product.</li>
<li >Look for a type that you can digest. Many brands contain digestive enzymes or are fermented to make the nutrients more gut-friendly.</li>
<li >Look for a type that contains the source you want. For instance, if you're a plant-based eater, skip the whey, egg, or bone broth protein and look for vegan blends.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are many high-quality brands that follow these guidelines.</p>

<p><strong >A Super Shake is a meal, not a drink.</strong></p>
<p>Shakes taste great and go down easy. Try to take your time. Sip instead of guzzling. Enjoy and stop when you're satisfied. Your digestion (and waistline) will thank you.</p>
