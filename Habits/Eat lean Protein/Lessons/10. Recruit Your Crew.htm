<h1 >Find a new friend.</h1> 
<p>Finding new friends can be intimidating. But it doesn't have to be. Here's our magic trick for doing it. Are you ready?</p> 
<p>&quot;Hi.&quot; [&nbsp;<em >smile</em>&nbsp;]</p> 
<p>Yep, it's just that simple.</p> 
<p>If you belong to a gym, you probably see regulars. Next time you see one, smile and say hello. Or heck, next time you see a stranger who looks cool, do the same.</p> 
<p>You don't need a pickup line, it's not speed dating. It's basic social interaction.</p> 
<p>Try having a short conversation with someone at your gym. You don't have to discuss philosophy. First try 5 minutes of chatting. Make eye contact, smile, and be pleasant.</p> 
<p>For example,</p> 
<p>&quot;Wow, that is an impressive lift. Nice job.&quot;</p> 
<p>&quot;I see you here most mornings—you are so diligent! How do you do it?&quot;</p> 
<p>&quot;I've been coming here for a while and I notice... [insert their progress here]&quot;</p> 
<p>Before you know it, the gym may be a much more friendly place.</p> 
<p>Another option for finding new friends is to find a shared activity.</p> 
<p>For instance:</p> 
<ul type=disc > 
<li ><strong >Take a new class, and be friendly when you do it.</strong>&nbsp;Check out what community centers, college continuing education, and/or local gyms have to offer. Always wanted to try dragon boating? Horseback riding? Competitive horseshoes? Start Googling. And vow to say hello to at least two people every time you do the class.</li> 
<li ><strong >Check out&nbsp;<a href="http://www.meetup.com/" target="_blank" >meetup.com</a>&nbsp;to see gatherings in your area.</strong>&nbsp;Whether it's heli-skiing, rock climbing, hiking, or strongwoman competitions, you're bound to find something you enjoy, and some event where you can hang out with other fit people.</li> 
</ul> 
</section>
<section id="ember113" > 
<h1 >Enjoy old friends.</h1> 
<p>You might already have a good roster of ready-made fit friends. Start by thinking of who you already know. Partner? Significant other? Kids? Family members? Friends? Coworkers? Etc.</p> 
<p>Do you want to try to restart a relationship? How can you spend time with them in a way that's healthy and active?</p> 
<p>For instance:</p> 
<ul type=disc > 
<li >play with your kids at the park</li> 
<li >go on an &quot;activity date&quot; with your partner or significant other—go cycling, dancing, hiking, etc. together</li> 
<li >walk the dog together as a family</li> 
<li >meet a friend for a workout or a physical activity outing (such as a fun class) instead of dinner/drinks</li> 
<li >have &quot;walking meetings&quot; with your coworkers—solve your company problems outside during a brisk stroll</li> 
<li >set up intramural sports at work</li> 
</ul> 
<p>Who knows—you may discover that the accounting department houses a herd of badminton friends or that you can put together a powerlifting team of nurses.</p> 
<p>If your family/friends aren't super-sporty, even a gentle stroll around the mall or ramble to the local coffee shop counts.</p>
