<p><b>What do you do when you &#64257;rst get into a car?</b></p>
<p><b>Hopefully, you put your seatbelt on.</b></p>
<p>You know that if you were to hit something at full speed, you couldn't possibly brace yourself against the dashboard enough to save yourself. You're going too fast, and the force is too strong.</p>
<p>Without that seatbelt, you're probably going &#64258;ying.</p>
<p>So, no problem. You click the seatbelt, and forget about it.</p>
<p>You go on your merry way. Safely. Without worrying about having to suddenly bench press the dashboard.</p>
<p><b>The same idea applies to your healthy habits.</b></p>
<p>Most of us live our lives at full speed, whizzing through decision after decision after decision.</p>
<p>We're busy. We're tired. We're rushed.</p>
<p>We're focused on other stuff—work, kids, school, traf&#64257;c, that email from the boss... so many other things are grabbing our attention.</p>
<p>It's like the scenery zipping past our car as we navigate the madness of highway traf&#64257;c. After making decisions like crazy, at the end of the day, brains are exhausted.</p>
<p>This is often when we feel like we &quot;lose control&quot;, drifting lanes, veering off the road onto rumblestrips.</p>
<p>That's normal.</p>
<p><b>Create your trusted &quot;safety system&quot;.</b></p>
<p>We might think that we &quot;need more willpower&quot; in order to change to maintain healthy habits.</p>
<p>Although willpower and motivation are great things, it helps us more to have a trusted &quot;safety system&quot; in the form of our daily routines or environment.</p>
<p>If food is around you, you'll probably eventually eat it.</p>
<p>That can work in your favor, if healthy food is nearby and easy to prep. Or, that can work against you, if unhealthy food is within arm's reach.</p>
<p>Often, decisions are dictated by the environment, and have a lot less to do with &quot;willpower&quot;.</p>
<p>Creating a &quot;safety system&quot;, we ask our surroundings to help us make the right choices... without having to think so much about it. Click the seatbelt, and you're done.</p>
<p><b>Make it easier by using your surroundings to your advantage.</b></p>
<p>Make your routines and environment support your coaching journey.</p>
<p><b>Keep healthy stuff near you and convenient. Make it easier to make a wise choice, or the choice that aligns with your goals.</b></p>
<p>For example, you can try:</p>
<ul type=disc>
<li >Having ready-to-go fruits and vegetables on hand, such as baby carrots or cherry tomatoes.</li>
<li >Packing your workout clothes (or a healthy lunch) the night before. In the morning, it's grab and go.</li>
</ul>
<p>Another simple way to do this is to stick a couple of environmental cues together: Add a new cue to a familiar routine.</p>
<p>For instance, you already go to the bathroom. If you want to drink more water, try leaving a water glass by the bathroom sink. Now, going to the bathroom is your cue to have a glass of water. Almost no memory work required.</p>
<p><b>Keep unhealthy stuff away from you and inconvenient. Make it more difficult (or irritatingly labor-intensive) to make a poor choice.</b></p>
<p>For example:</p>
<ul type=disc>
<li >Keep foods that you don't want to eat out of the house, if possible. When the late-night munchies hit, it'll seem like a lot more work to get up and go to the store.</li>
<li >Tell someone else about the healthy choices you plan to make, to keep yourself accountable. It's a lot harder to go back on a promise to someone else.</li>
</ul>
<p>When you look for ways to make things easier, something else is doing all the work for you–your environment. What a relief!</p>
<p><b>Keep paying attention to your environment today.</b></p>
<p><b>How do the people, things, and daily routines around you affect your decisions?</b></p>
<p>Notice and name what affects your choices.</p>
<p>No need to change anything today, just observe.</p>
