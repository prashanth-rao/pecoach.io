<section id="ember190" >What to do today</h1>
<li> <strong >Notice how the spaces you live in, and the people around you, affect your decisions.</strong></li>
<p>For instance:</p>
<ul type=disc >
<ul type=circle>
<li >What's around you in your physical environment, such as your home, workplace, or community?</li>
<li >Who's around you in your social environment, such as friends, family, roommates, or coworkers?</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<li> <strong >Consider how you might make small adjustments in your environment to improve your decisions so that you don't need as much &quot;willpower&quot;.</strong></li>
<p>You don't have to change anything immediately. Just start by noticing.</p>

<section id="ember191" >
<h1 >What's around us shapes our choices.</h1>
<p>We make literally hundreds of food decisions every day.</p>
<p><em >Coffee or tea? Peanut butter or jam? Should I start or finish this taco?</em></p>
<p>We're not aware that we're making most of those decisions. We often can't explain them. We're not consciously choosing.</p>
<p>We just… make them. We sort of &quot;find ourselves&quot; somewhere, or doing something.</p>
<p>We just float along, like leaves down a river, with the people around us. The situation. Our habits. Familiar routines.</p>
<p>This isn’t wrong. It's pretty normal.</p>
<p>But, it means that we sometimes don't realize when our environment (such as the things and people around us) shape our choices.</p>
<p>In fact, our environment drives our eating and activity behaviors way more than we realize.</p>
</section>
<section id="ember192" >
<h1 >Make your environment work <em >for</em> you.</h1>
<p>The good news? By changing your environment—even just a little bit—you can put yourself back in control.</p>
<p><strong >Notice and name your cues.</strong></p>
<p>Don't worry about changing your whole routine and environment right now.</p>
<p><strong >Today, just notice and name what elements of your environment are helping you or hindering you.</strong></p>
<ul type=disc >
<li >Your schedule?</li>
<li >Your route to work or school?</li>
<li >The people around you?</li>
<li >Food advertisements?</li>
<li >The lunch room or communal candy jar at work?</li>
<li >Your morning, lunchtime, or evening rituals?</li>
<li >What's in your cupboards or fridge?</li>
<li >What's near you? (e.g., gyms, grocery stores, walking trails, etc.)</li>
<li >Social media?</li>
<li >Etc.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong >Look around. Observe. Pay attention.</strong></p>
<p>Stay aware of what you're seeing, doing, and experiencing.</p>
<p>See what factors affect your behavior.</p>
<p>Start to notice patterns and connections.</p>
<ul type=disc >
<li >Do you have people, systems, routines, and/or things around you that support your goals and the changes you want to make?</li>
<li >What could make your environment just a little bit better?</li>
<li >What do <em >you</em> need in order to be <em >your</em> healthiest, leanest, fittest self?</li>
</ul>
<p>Today, just observe. Notice and name. You don't have to change anything just yet.</p>
