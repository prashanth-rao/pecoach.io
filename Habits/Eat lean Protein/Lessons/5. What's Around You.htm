<section id="ember190" >What to do today</h1> 
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong >Notice how the spaces you live in, and the people around you, affect your decisions.</strong></p> 
<p>For instance:</p> 
<ul type=disc > 
<ul type=circle> 
<li >What's around you in your physical environment, such as your home, workplace, or community?</li> 
<li >Who's around you in your social environment, such as friends, family, roommates, or coworkers?</li> 
</ul> 
</ul> 
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong >Consider how you might make small adjustments in your environment to improve your decisions so that you don't need as much &quot;willpower&quot;.</strong></p> 
<p>You don't have to change anything immediately. Just start by noticing.</p> 
</section>
<section id="ember191" > 
<h1 >What's around us shapes our choices.</h1> 
<p>We make literally hundreds of food decisions every day.</p> 
<p><em >Coffee or tea? Peanut butter or jam? Should I start or finish this taco?</em></p> 
<p>We're not aware that we're making most of those decisions. We often can't explain them. We're not consciously choosing.</p> 
<p>We just… make them. We sort of &quot;find ourselves&quot; somewhere, or doing something.</p> 
<p>We just float along, like leaves down a river, with the people around us. The situation. Our habits. Familiar routines.</p> 
<p>This isn’t wrong. It's pretty normal.</p> 
<p>But, it means that we sometimes don't realize when our environment (such as the things and people around us) shape our choices.</p> 
<p>In fact, our environment drives our eating and activity behaviors way more than we realize.</p>

<section id="ember192" > 
<h1 >Make your environment work&nbsp;<em >for</em>&nbsp;you.</h1> 
<p>The good news? By changing your environment—even just a little bit—you can put yourself back in control.</p> 
<p><strong >Notice and name your cues.</strong></p> 
<p>Don't worry about changing your whole routine and environment right now.</p> 
<p><strong >Today, just notice and name what elements of your environment are helping you or hindering you.</strong></p> 
<ul type=disc > 
<li >Your schedule?</li> 
<li >Your route to work or school?</li> 
<li >The people around you?</li> 
<li >Food advertisements?</li> 
<li >The lunch room or communal candy jar at work?</li> 
<li >Your morning, lunchtime, or evening rituals?</li> 
<li >What's in your cupboards or fridge?</li> 
<li >What's near you? (e.g., gyms, grocery stores, walking trails, etc.)</li> 
<li >Social media?</li> 
<li >Etc.</li> 
</ul> 
<p><strong >Look around. Observe. Pay attention.</strong></p> 
<p>Stay aware of what you're seeing, doing, and experiencing.</p> 
<p>See what factors affect your behavior.</p> 
<p>Start to notice patterns and connections.</p> 
<ul type=disc > 
<li >Do you have people, systems, routines, and/or things around you that support your goals and the changes you want to make?</li> 
<li >What could make your environment just a little bit better?</li> 
<li >What do&nbsp;<em >you</em>&nbsp;need in order to be&nbsp;<em >your</em>&nbsp;healthiest, leanest, fittest self?</li> 
</ul> 
<p>Today, just observe. Notice and name. You don't have to change anything just yet.</p>
