<p>If you want to make smart choices easier and more convenient, adding healthy foods so that they're readily available is an important step.</p> 
<p><strong >Starting with your friendly grocery store.</strong></p> 
<p>With a clear plan and priorities, you can make shopping efficient and effective.</p> 
<p>You can fill up your fridge, freezer, and pantry with healthy staples so that they're there when you need them.</p> 
<p>Here are a few tips to make your shopping trips go smoothly.</p>

<h1 >Have a grocery store game plan.</h1> 
<p><strong >Use a list.</strong></p> 
<p>If it's not on the list, don't buy it. That saves you time, money, and having to throw out impulse buys that don't end up serving your goals.</p> 
<p>Here's a shopping list you can customize and use to guide your decision making.</p>

<p>If you want more ideas, there are many apps that will help you build daily or weekly menus, and create shopping lists from them.</p> 
<p><strong >Know supermarket geography</strong></p> 
<p>Most supermarkets are laid out the same way:</p> 
<ul type=disc > 
<li >Most of the green-light healthy stuff is around the edges.</li> 
<li >Most of the stuff to avoid is in the inner aisles, and beside the checkout.</li> 
</ul> 
<p><strong >Plan your attack and movements.</strong></p> 
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Stick mostly to the perimeter, where you'll find lean protein plus fruits and veggies.</p> 
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Be especially cautious around the cash register and ends of the aisles, where there are often eye-catching displays of junk. (And yes, the bakery is the first thing you smell when you walk in... for good reason.)</p> 
<p><strong >Read the ingredient and nutrition labels.</strong></p> 
<p>Remember that many food manufacturers make false health claims, or put their product into an appealing package. Any claims made on the front of the package (such as &quot;natural&quot;) mean nothing.</p> 
<p>Stay skeptical. Check ingredients. And honestly, if you find yourself always reading ingredient lists, you may want to adjust some of the foods you buy.</p> 
<p><strong >Buy the best quality food you can afford.</strong></p> 
<p>This doesn't mean get a $50 jar of mustard. It means consider how to prioritize food quality in your buying decisions, whatever your budget is.</p>

<p>Do a kitchen cleanout to create an environment that supports you.</p> 
<p>Coach's Notes:&nbsp;Making over the kitchen -- removing &quot;red light&quot; foods and adding &quot;green light&quot; foods.</p> 
<div > 
<p>Top of Form</p> 
</div> 
<p><b>Improving what's around you improves your choices.</b></p> 
<p>To create a supportive environment you'll want to:</p> 
<ul type=disc> 
<li >Keep healthy stuff near you and convenient.</li> 
<li >Make your routines and environment support your coaching journey.</li> 
<li >If something works against you, make it difficult and inconvenient, so it's less likely to happen or harder to do.</li> 
</ul> 
<p>That includes, of course, your kitchen.</p> 
<p><b>A &quot;kitchen makeover&quot; (or even a few small changes) makes things easy.</b></p> 
<p>When you have a clear structure and a trusted system, you don't have to think. You can just execute. And it's simple.</p> 
<p>Over the coming days, consider how you can build a &quot;friendly kitchen&quot; that helps you make wise choices.</p> 
<p><b>Here's a step-by-step process for &quot;upgrading&quot; your kitchen environment.</b></p> 
<p><b>Do what works for&nbsp;<i>you</i>.</b></p> 
<p>What do&nbsp;<i>you</i>&nbsp;need in a healthy kitchen?</p> 
<p>What matches&nbsp;<i>your</i>&nbsp;living situation and daily routine?</p> 
<p>What helps you make better food decisions, or to stay on track?</p> 
<p>What do you need in order to make things easier, simpler, and more manageable?</p> 
<p><b>Try this at your own speed.</b></p> 
<p>You can tackle one small thing now, and then return to the project later. Or you can go scorched-earth/Extreme Kitchen Makeover reality TV on it.</p> 
<p>It's up to you.</p> 
<p><b>This is an experiment.</b></p> 
<p>You don't have to &quot;get it all&quot; at once. You're just trying something new.</p> 
<p><b>Step 1: Prepare</b></p> 
<p>Prepare your mindset, your tools, your triage plan, and the people around you (if there are any).</p> 
<p><b>Prepare your mindset.</b></p> 
<p>Think about what you want out of this process.</p> 
<ul type=disc> 
<li >Do you want a kitchen that serves a high-performance athlete?</li> 
<li >Do you want a kitchen that streamlines meal prep?</li> 
<li >Do you want a kitchen that's tidy and feels pleasant to be in?</li> 
<li >Do you just want to be able to finally find the vegetables in the fridge underneath the piles of old Tupperware?</li> 
<li >Etc.</li> 
</ul> 
<p>You decide.</p> 
<p><b>Prepare your tools.</b></p> 
<p>Get a few big garbage bags, and your compost bin if you've got one.</p> 
<p><b>Prepare your triage plan.</b></p> 
<p><b>There are no rules here.</b>&nbsp;<i>You</i>&nbsp;decide what foods and items to keep, minimize, move, and/or discard.</p> 
<p>Rather than thinking about &quot;good&quot; or &quot;bad&quot; foods, try the &quot;traffic light&quot; concept: Red, yellow, and green-light foods.</p> 
<ul type=disc> 
<li ><b>Red-light foods are foods that are just bad news for you.</b>&nbsp;Maybe they make you feel sick, or they trigger you to eat too much, or you know they're an unhealthy choice for you, etc. Red means &quot;no go&quot;.</li> 
<li ><b>Yellow-light foods are foods that are sometimes OK, sometimes not.</b>&nbsp;Maybe you can eat a little bit without feeling ill, or you can eat them sanely at a restaurant with others but not at home alone, or you can have them as an occasional treat, etc. Yellow means &quot;approach with caution&quot;.</li> 
<li ><b>Green-light foods are foods that make you feel good mentally and physically.</b>&nbsp;You can eat them sanely and mindfully, in the right amounts. These are usually things like fruits and vegetables, lean protein, legumes, etc. Green means &quot;go for it!&quot;</li> 
</ul> 
<p>Each person will have a slightly different list of red, yellow, and green lights.</p> 
<p>You might leave ice cream in the freezer untouched for months, whereas another person might need a restraining order from Ben &amp; Jerry's.</p> 
<p><b>Prepare the people around you.</b></p> 
<p>If you live with other people, let them know that you'd like to tidy out the kitchen to help make healthy choices easier.</p> 
<p>Ask for their input and help, and/or negotiate a solution where everyone can win and get their needs met.</p> 
<p>For example:</p> 
<ul type=disc> 
<li >Have a designated shelf or cupboard for &quot;your stuff&quot; and &quot;their stuff&quot;.</li> 
<li >Agree to only purchase small quantities of red- or yellow-light foods—enough for an occasional special meal, no more. (In other words, no more buckets of peanut butter or pillowcase-sized bags of chips.)</li> 
<li >Instead of banning all family favorites, try agreeing to have them a little less often.</li> 
<li >Etc.</li> 
</ul> 
<p>Figure out how you can get what&nbsp;<i>you</i>&nbsp;need to succeed, while still respecting others' needs and wishes.</p> 
<p>Quick tip! Healthier environments for you also create healthier environments for others. Creating a healthy kitchen benefits everyone.</p> 
<p><b>Step 2: Start with the easy fixes.</b></p> 
<p><b>Look for some immediate wins.</b></p> 
<ol > 
<li ><b>Remove or minimize red-light foods (or make them somehow inconvenient).</b></li> 
</ol> 
<p>Review what foods are red-light foods for&nbsp;<i>you</i>. For most people, red-light foods are processed foods such as candy, chips, cookies, etc.</p> 
<p>If you know or suspect certain foods trigger you into unhealthy behaviors: Get them out of easy reach. Make that stuff go away... or at least hard to get to. Safety first!</p> 
<ol > 
<li ><b>Get rid of expired foods.</b></li> 
</ol> 
<p>Dig into the back of your freezer, fridge, and/or pantry, check &quot;best-before&quot; dates, and dump any food that’s way past due, weird colors, and/or furry.</p> 
<p><b>Step 3: Make some informed choices about what else to keep or discard.</b></p> 
<p>After eliminating obvious red-light and possibly poisonous foods, now you have to make some more analytical choices.</p> 
<p>Gather some data to decide on your next steps.</p> 
<p><b>Check ALL labels. Read them carefully.</b></p> 
<p>Never assume any product is &quot;healthy&quot; or &quot;natural&quot; or &quot;crap-free&quot;. Manufacturers are sneaky!</p> 
<p>When in doubt ask yourself a few questions:</p> 
<ol start=1 type=1> 
<li >Does this food come in a bag, box, or plastic package?</li> 
<li >What's on the label? What are the ingredients?</li> 
<li >How far away is this food from what it used to be? (And do you even know what it used to be?)</li> 
<li >Based on your findings, decide whether these foods you've evaluated are worth keeping.</li> 
</ol> 
<p><b>Step 4: Choose your trade-offs.</b></p> 
<p>Once you've eliminated some obvious triggers and foods full of industrial chemicals, now you get to the negotiation stage.</p> 
<ul type=disc> 
<li >What are you willing to keep... with modifications?</li> 
<li >What is an effective compromise for others in your household (if there are others)? Is there a way to arrange things so everyone wins?</li> 
</ul> 
<p>For instance:</p> 
<ul type=disc> 
<li >Is there a way to &quot;upgrade&quot; familiar favorites to healthier versions?</li> 
<li >Can you try making things like salad dressing from scratch?</li> 
<li >Does having a small amount of yellow-light foods make it easier to have green-light foods? (For instance, does a sprinkle of croutons or splash of store-bought dressing make it easier for you to eat a salad? Then keep those things.)</li> 
<li >Can you put red-light foods into a place that's hard for you to get to, but relatively easy for others who aren't willing to part with them?</li> 
<li >Can you all agree to keep &quot;treats&quot; that others like, but you don't find to be triggers? (e.g., if your spouse likes chips, but you find them &quot;meh&quot;, consider that a potential win-win situation.)</li> 
</ul> 
<p><b>Be reasonable and mature. Know yourself and your needs, wants, and habits.</b></p> 
<p>What do you need? What do others need? How can you balance those things while still staying on track to your goals?</p> 
<p>What is &quot;good enough&quot; for right now?</p> 
<p><b>Whatever you choose, choose with purpose and awareness.</b></p> 
<p><b>Step 5: Recycle, dispose, compost.</b></p> 
<p>Don't feel bad about &quot;wasting food&quot;.</p> 
<p>Most of what you'll throw out as red-light foods and yellow-light foods aren't actually foods.</p> 
<p>If a food that you're discarding has some value (for instance, a can of beans that's a red-light food for your digestion but still perfectly good), donate it to a local food bank or soup kitchen. Or if possible, toss it in the compost and feel good about giving back to the earth.</p> 
<p>Otherwise, it goes in the garbage. Sayonara, self-sabotage!</p> 
<p><b>Step 6: Consider what to add.</b></p> 
<p>Your fridge and pantry might look a little desolate after getting rid of the unhealthy foods.</p> 
<p>They won't be empty for long because you're going to fill them back up with healthy, muscle-building replacements for the garbage you just unloaded.</p> 
<p>Take a moment to notice:</p> 
<ul type=disc> 
<li >What could you add to make healthy eating easier and more convenient?</li> 
<li >Do you need any more equipment? (For instance, good knives or Tupperware?)</li> 
</ul> 
<p>Eating well isn't just about &quot;taking stuff away&quot;. Mostly, it's about adding good stuff and enabling healthy routines.</p> 
<p><b>The Kitchen Makeover in action</b></p> 
<p>If you'd like to see one way to do a kitchen makeover, here's a home video of Lisa, a nutrition coach, working through a kitchen makeover with her best friend, Jenifer.</p> 
<p>Notice how they:</p> 
<ul type=disc> 
<li >Talk through what the makeover might involve</li> 
<li >Go through and decide what to do with each food, and why (notice they use a 3-part category system of &quot;Keep&quot;, &quot;Discard&quot;, and &quot;Discuss&quot;).</li> 
<li >Do some meal planning, based on things Jenifer likes</li> 
<li >Stock up on healthy goodies</li> 
<li >Talk about what the process was like, afterwards, and think about what they learned</li> 
</ul>
