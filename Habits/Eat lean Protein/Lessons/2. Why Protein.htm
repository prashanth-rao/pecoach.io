<p><b>Why protein is powerful.</b></p>
<p><b>Protein is an essential nutrient with many crucial jobs.</b></p>
<ul type=disc>
<li ><b>Protein helps make many hormones.</b> This includes hormones that manage appetite, balance blood sugar, and support feeling happy and relaxed.</li>
<li ><b>Protein supports the immune system.</b> Without enough protein, we easily become sick and frail, and recover slower.</li>
<li ><b>Protein improves body composition.</b> It helps shed fat, gain or maintain muscle mass, and stay lean for life.</li>
<li ><b>Protein is physically satisfying. You'll feel fuller, longer.</b> This is important if you're trying to eat less in order to lose fat. Eating more protein means feeling more satisfied with meals, and less hungry between meals.</li>
<li ><b>Protein helps build and repair almost every tissue in the body</b> — muscles, connective tissues (such as tendons and ligaments), and bones.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>More protein means better recovery, more muscle, less fat, and a stronger, healthier body.</b></p>
<p>No matter what your goals are, having a solid protein intake is one of the most important practices you can do for your overall health, fitness, and performance.</p>
