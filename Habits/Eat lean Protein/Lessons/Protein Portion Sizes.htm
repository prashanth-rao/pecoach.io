<p><b>How much protein should you eat?</b></p> 
<p><b>First, tune in to your body's appetite cues.</b></p> 
<ul type=disc> 
<li >Before you eat, pause and ask yourself if you're truly physically hungry.</li> 
<li >Eat slowly and mindfully, even for only a few bites.</li> 
<li >Notice when you start to feel satisfied, and stop… even if there's food left on your plate.</li> 
</ul> 
<p><b>Then, for more objective measures, one palm is ~1 serving of protein.</b></p> 
<p>You can start by targeting about 1 palm-sized serving of high-protein foods per meal.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>One reason this works is that it's a general ballpark measurement, rather than precise. It's an easy way to start practicing including some lean protein at as many meals as possible.</p> 
<p><b>Work with yourself.</b></p> 
<p><b>Keep it simple.</b></p> 
<ul type=disc> 
<li >Learn what foods are high in protein.</li> 
<li >Stock up on those foods and keep them handy.</li> 
<li >Work on adding them to your regular menu.</li> 
</ul> 
<p><b>Make it easy.</b></p> 
<ul type=disc> 
<li >If it's more convenient to buy your protein sources pre-prepped (e.g., rotisserie chicken, canned tuna or beans), do so.</li> 
<li >Choose sources that you like and will eat.</li> 
<li >For more challenge, experiment. Try improving the food quality (e.g., organic or pastured meat, wild-caught fish, free-range eggs).</li> 
</ul> 
<p><b>It doesn't have to be perfect.</b></p> 
<ul type=disc> 
<li >Experiment. See what works for you.</li> 
<li >Even one meal with a little more protein is a success.</li>
