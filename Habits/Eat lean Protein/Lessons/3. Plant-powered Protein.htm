<p><b>Plant-powered Protein</b></p> 
<p>Use plant foods to boost your protein intake.</p> 
<p>Coach's Notes:&nbsp;Protein sources for plant-based eaters and the idea that protein adds up.</p> 
<div > 
<p>Top of Form</p> 
</div> 
<p><b>Most foods have at least some protein.</b></p> 
<p>You'll see from our suggested shopping list that animal-based foods are typically higher in protein than many plant-based foods.</p> 
<p>While plants&nbsp;<i>contain</i>&nbsp;protein, they don't have as much protein per volume as animal foods such as beef, chicken, or fish. Plants are not protein dense.</p> 
<p><b>Still, it all adds up.</b></p> 
<p>For example, a bowl of chili con carne contains:</p> 
<ul type=disc> 
<li >3 ounces of ground beef = 21 g protein</li> 
<li >1 ounce of corn = 3 g protein</li> 
<li >¼ cup of black beans = 4 g protein</li> 
<li >2 ounces of avocado guacamole = 2 g protein</li> 
<li ><b>Total: 30 g protein</b></li> 
</ul> 
<p>In this example, beef still has the&nbsp;<i>most</i>&nbsp;protein.</p> 
<p>And notice: plants provide 9 grams—about one-third—of the protein content of this meal.</p> 
<p><b>Think about how you can add protein wherever possible to every meal, even in small increments.</b></p> 
<p><b>Make plant protein work for you.</b></p> 
<p>If you're a mostly plant-based eater (e.g., vegetarian or vegan), with some careful menu planning, you can meet high protein needs with plants.</p> 
<p>It's hard to get enough protein accidentally or without a deliberate effort.</p> 
<p><b>You can try...</b></p> 
<p>Higher-protein grains, such as:</p> 
<ul type=disc> 
<li >amaranth</li> 
<li >buckwheat</li> 
<li >millet</li> 
<li >oats</li> 
<li >quinoa</li> 
<li >sorghum</li> 
<li >spelt</li> 
<li >teff</li> 
<li >wild rice</li> 
</ul> 
<p>Beans and legumes, such as:</p> 
<ul type=disc> 
<li >black, red, white, or pinto beans</li> 
<li >chickpeas (garbanzo beans)</li> 
<li >edamame (soybeans)</li> 
<li >lentils</li> 
<li >bean-based noodles and pastas (which are also great for many people who can't tolerate wheat)</li> 
</ul> 
<p>Plant-based protein powders, such as:</p> 
<ul type=disc> 
<li >pea</li> 
<li >rice</li> 
<li >hemp or pumpkin seed</li> 
<li >soy</li> 
<li >other vegan and plant-based blends</li> 
</ul> 
<p><b>Everyone can win.</b></p> 
<p><b>Help protein do its job of keeping you satisfied by slowing down and relaxing while you eat.</b></p> 
<p>No matter if it's animal, vegetable, or mineral, eat your food slowly and mindfully whenever you can. Stop when you're no longer hungry... even if you haven't officially finished the full protein portion.</p> 
<p>Enjoy lots of different plant foods along with your other protein choices. Especially if eaten slowly and thoughtfully, all the little proteins are all adding up.</p>
