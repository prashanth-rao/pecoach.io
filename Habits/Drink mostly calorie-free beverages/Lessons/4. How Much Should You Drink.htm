<p>Coach's Notes:&nbsp;The basics of hydration and how to get your intake right; avoiding over-hydration.</p>

<h1 >
<section id="ember111" >We are made (mostly) of water.</h1> 
<p>On average, about 70% of the human body is water. So, water is important for keeping us healthy.</p> 
<p><strong >How much water should you drink?</strong></p> 
<p>It depends.</p> 
<p>The modern &quot;hydration industry&quot; has convinced many people in the world of health and fitness that dehydration is a terrifying fate to be avoided at all costs.</p> 
<p>Whether it's a bandolier-style &quot;hydration belt&quot; or buckets of blue &quot;sports recovery drink&quot;, products that supposedly help us stay hydrated abound.</p> 
<p>Should we worry about this? Before we freak, how much hydration do we&nbsp;<em >really</em>&nbsp;need?</p>

<h1 >Many factors affect our fluid needs.</h1> 
<p>The oft-cited guideline of &quot;Drink X glasses of water a day&quot; isn't based on evidence. It's one of those things that gets repeated often enough to become &quot;well-known&quot;.</p> 
<p>The science doesn't actually support a one-size-fits-all &quot;drink rule&quot;.</p> 
<p><strong >Each person's individual fluid needs will depend on things like:</strong></p> 
<ul type=disc > 
<li ><strong >Sweating</strong>: Obviously this is an important part of exercise. Sweat a lot, and you'll need to replace more fluid (and electrolytes; see below).</li> 
<li ><strong >Body size</strong>: Smaller adults have a smaller volume and surface area. Thus, they lose relatively less fluid than larger adults via respiration and sweating. (However, children can become dehydrated easily.)</li> 
<li ><strong >Climate, humidity, and altitude</strong>: Dry, hot climates and/or high altitudes suck fluid away from our bodies faster.</li> 
<li ><strong >Salty food</strong>: We take in salts from our diets. When this happens, we may retain water or feel thirstier, and want to drink more. (The same is often true of sweet foods.)</li> 
<li ><strong >Alcohol</strong>: Alcohol makes us lose water at first, and then we often feel dehydrated and thirsty.</li> 
<li ><strong >Hormones</strong>: If you're a woman of reproductive age, your hormones will change your body water levels throughout your cycle.</li> 
<li ><strong >Digestion and excretion</strong>: If you're finding it hard to poop, adding more water will help move things through. And, if you've had diarrhea or vomiting recently, you'll definitely want to replace that lost fluid.</li> 
</ul> 
</section>
<section id="ember114" > 
<h1 >Start simple.</h1> 
<p>For sure, water and proper fluid balance is pretty important for life. You can keep it simple, not over-think, and not over-drink.</p> 
<p><strong >Start with a simple set of daily practices. Work on doing them consistently:</strong></p> 
<ul type=disc > 
<li ><strong >Drink when you're thirsty, plus a little extra</strong>. Have a few extra sips or swigs here and there, just to boost the signal.</li> 
<li ><strong >Have a glass of water with your meals</strong>. Taking sips of water between bites can slow you down, and help you eat mindfully.</li> 
<li ><strong >Help yourself remember to hydrate</strong>. Leave a glass by the bathroom or kitchen sink, and have a glass each time you pass by. Or put a water bottle by your workstation.</li> 
<li ><strong >If you feel hunger or cravings, try having a glass of water first, to see if what you're feeling is thirst, rather than hunger.</strong></li> 
<li ><strong >Include fruits and vegetables in your diet, which also add water</strong>.</li> 
</ul> 
<p>Simple practices like these can support a habit of drinking water regularly throughout the day. Drinking water regularly every day is the only guideline that most people will need in order to stay hydrating.</p> 
<p>Most of the time, there's no need to be fancy or too precise.</p> 
</section>
<section id="ember115" > 
<h1 >Add some extras if you need them.</h1> 
<p>If you:</p> 
<ul type=disc > 
<li >are very active (for instance, your workouts are intense and last longer than 60-90 minutes);</li> 
<li >are in a hot and/or dry environment, and/or at higher altitudes;</li> 
<li >tend to sweat a lot when you move around; and/or</li> 
<li >consume alcohol regularly (which is dehydrating),</li> 
</ul> 
<p>Then you may want to consider drinking more, and adding supplemental electrolytes (dissolved salts such as sodium and potassium).</p> 
<p>&quot;Drinking more&quot; could mean, for example:</p> 
<ul type=disc > 
<li >Follow the basic guidelines above of drinking water throughout the day.</li> 
<li >When you're exercising, drink about 0.5-1 liter (1-4 cups) of water per hour of physical activity.</li> 
<li >Drink about 0.5-1 liter (1-4 cups) of water in the hour or so afterwards.</li> 
</ul> 
<p>Unlike many biological stimuli, we don't &quot;adapt&quot; to dehydration. We can't &quot;train&quot; to become better at being dehydrated. We must replenish those lost fluids.</p> 
<p><strong >Adding electrolytes</strong></p> 
<p>Consider adding some electrolytes for longer workouts, or training sessions where you lose a lot of water (and thus might be drinking more).</p> 
<p>Sodium tells your body to hang on to the water it has, rather than dumping it overboard. It also helps to maintain blood pressure and electrolyte balance, and allows organs, muscles and nerves to work properly.</p> 
<p>If you're drinking a lot of water, it's a good idea to add electrolytes, particularly sodium.</p> 
<p>Drinking enormous amounts of water too quickly (in the neighborhood of 2-3 L per hour for a few hours), without replacing electrolyte/minerals properly, can lead to electrolyte imbalances in our body.</p> 
<p>For most people, this situation (known as&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000394.htm" target="_blank" >hyponatremia</a>) isn't a problem. It generally only happens to endurance athletes who train for hours, sweat significantly (losing lots of sodium in their sweat), and drink gallons of plain water without ever replenishing their sodium levels.</p> 
<p>To add these electrolytes:</p> 
<ul type=disc > 
<li ><strong >Salt your food normally</strong>. If you're craving salt, go ahead and have some. In women especially, salt cravings are often there for a good reason. If you're out on the trails and have food with you, toss a little salt into your trail mix.</li> 
<li ><strong >If you're drinking a lot of water, make sure you're also consuming electrolytes along with it</strong>. You can choose sports drinks with electrolytes included, or look in your local drugstore for a lower-calorie powder such as Pedialyte, which is designed for fluid and electrolyte replenishment.</li> 
<li ><strong >Try natural mineral waters, such as San Pellegrino or Gerolsteiner</strong>. These have dissolved minerals in them already, and are also a nice substitute for soda.</li> 
</ul>

<section id="ember116" >Should you consume caffeine?</h1> 
<p>It depends.</p> 
<p><strong >Our ability to tolerate caffeine is partly genetic.</strong></p> 
<p>Some people are &quot;fast metabolizers&quot;, meaning they process caffeine effectively and it isn't as likely to cause health complications.</p> 
<p>Others are &quot;slow metabolizers&quot;. In excess, caffeine can increase their risk of disease.</p> 
<p>In general, most who drink about 1 to 3 small cups of coffee or about 2 to 4 cups of regular black tea won't experience any significant disruptions.</p> 
<p><strong >Whether caffeine is a smart option also depends on lifestyle factors.</strong></p> 
<p>Many people find that caffeine worsens carb cravings or hypoglycemia symptoms. If you find yourself jittery and sugar-jonesing an hour or two after a coffee, consider drinking less coffee, or cutting it with decaf.</p> 
<p>For some, caffeine may worsen other conditions, such as anxiety. For women, it may worsen unwelcome symptoms of menopause, such as hot flashes.</p> 
</section>
<section id="ember117" > 
<h1 >Considering coffee?</h1> 
<p>The flavor of black coffee can be intense. If you're already a fan of black coffee, you might appreciate it for a rich, nuanced taste. There's a hint of acidity, almost a sourness in some blends.</p> 
<p>If you're used to a coffee-type drink that's more like liquid chocolate cake, trying black coffee can be kind of a hairy experience at first. If you're interested in much lower-calorie options, going black could be worth it.</p> 
<p>Sensitizing to the subtle complexity of black coffee can take time. It can be a practice in appreciating finer qualities. Ultimately, it's an example of making a tradeoff for&nbsp;<em >better</em>, rather than deprivation.</p> 
<p>Black coffee is just one example. There are many finer-quality, lower-calorie options to find. To experiment, try consuming&nbsp;<em >less</em>&nbsp;in terms of calories, and&nbsp;<em >more</em>&nbsp;in terms of quality and experience.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong >Make it better</strong></p> 
<p>Today, why not treat yourself to a really awesome cup of coffee?</p> 
<p>Here are some options.</p> 
<ul type=disc > 
<li >Check out your local independent coffee shop. Ask for recommendations.</li> 
<li >Buy slightly better-quality beans than you're used to, and grind them fresh at home.</li> 
<li >If you're one of those people who's already a coffee aficionado and loves precision and chemistry experiments, try these tips for&nbsp;<a href="https://nategreen.org/how-to-make-the-perfect-cup-of-coffee/" target="_blank" >how to make the perfect cup of coffee</a>.</li>

<section id="ember120" > 
<h1 >Considering tea?</h1> 
<p>After being plucked from the&nbsp;<em >Camellia sinensis</em>&nbsp;plant, tea is fermented and processed.</p> 
<p>The more processing (heating and drying) the tea leaves undergo, the darker they turn.</p> 
<ul type=disc > 
<li >Green tea and white tea are the least processed tea</li> 
<li >Black and oolong teas are partially dried, crushed, and fermented.</li> 
</ul> 
<p>Regardless of the processing method, black, green, white and oolong teas all contain health-promoting polyphenols.</p> 
<p>In fact, tea ranks as high as or higher than many fruits and vegetables in the ORAC score, a score that measures antioxidant potential of plant-based foods.</p> 
<p>Thus, tea has many health benefits, plus about half the caffeine of coffee.</p> 
</section>
<section id="ember121" ><figure >

<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong >Make it better</strong></p> 
<p>Start with loose tea. Tea bags usually contain lower quality &quot;dust&quot; tea, a sort of waste product left over from sorting the higher quality loose leaf tea.</p> 
<p>(Of course, if you have bags, you can still use them. But loose leaf is better stuff, so consider upgrading!)</p> 
<p>There are literally hundreds of tea blends out there. Check out places like&nbsp;<a href="https://www.teavana.com/" target="_blank" >Teavana</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.republicoftea.com/" target="_blank" >The Republic of Tea</a>, or&nbsp;<a href="https://www.davidstea.com/" target="_blank" >David's Tea</a>.</p> 
<p>Dessert teas are often a nice substitute for something sweet after a meal. Double-check ingredients, as manufacturers often use sugar or artificial flavors, even in &quot;natural&quot; products.</p> 
</section>
<section id="ember123" > 
<h1 >Whatever you choose, drink it better.</h1> 
<p>There's a reason that a traditional Japanese tea ceremony is a careful, slow experience: It asks us to pause during our busy day and enjoy the details of the moment.</p> 
<p><strong >With your next cup of coffee or tea, try taking a few extra minutes to slow down.</strong></p> 
<p>Pause. Breathe.</p> 
<p>Sniff the coffee or tea. Taste it. Savor it.</p> 
<p>Watch the steam rise.</p> 
<p>If you're trying something new, be curious. What's it like? How does the flavor change from start to finish?</p> 
<p><strong >Rather than seeking a quick hit of caffeine, consider using coffee or tea drinking to step briefly out of your busy day and into a moment of calm and focus.</strong></p> 
<p><i>Drink your tea slowly and reverently, as if it is the axis on which the world earth revolves—slowly, evenly, without rushing toward the future.<br > —Thích Nh&#7845;t H&#7841;nh</i></p>
