<p>Coach's Notes:&nbsp;Explains how calories can sneak in to nutrition plans in beverages, and how adjusting drink intake is one of the easiest ways to lower energy intake.</p>

<section id="ember112" >It's easy to pay less attention to what we're drinking than to what we're eating.</h1> 
<p>It's also easy to be more conscious of how we exercise, and overlook what we drink.</p> 
<p>Yet drinks can be significant. Some drinks can contain a lot of extra calories, or ingredients we don't need.</p> 
<p>Here's a simple question you can ask yourself before you drink something:</p> 
<p><strong >Does this beverage I'm about to consume add value to my body?</strong></p> 
<p>For instance:</p> 
<ul type=disc > 
<li >Does it hydrate me?</li> 
<li >Does it replenish nutrients I've lost?</li> 
<li >Does it add value to health, and/or recovery?</li> 
<li >After I drink this, will I feel physically good and satisfied?</li> 
<li >After I drink this, will I feel happy and proud about my choice?</li> 
</ul> 
<p>If the answer to all of the above is yes, then go ahead and enjoy.</p> 
<p>If the answer is no, take a few moments to think about the choice.</p> 
<ul type=disc > 
<li >What trade-off are you willing to make? Why?</li> 
<li >What are you saying yes to? What are you saying no to? Why?</li> 
<li >Is there a better choice available? Why is it better?</li> 
</ul> 
</section>
<section id="ember113" > 
<h1 >Read labels.</h1> 
<p>Don't be fooled by what the front of the package says.</p> 
<p>Even if your beverage label claims it's exotic superfood hibiscus juice hand-raised by Hawaiian hippies who whisper sweet nothings to the drink to help it grow vitamins.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Yes, even this stuff. Check the labels.</p> 
</figcaption></figure></section>
<section id="ember115" > 
<p><strong >Read the label. Make an informed decision.</strong></p> 
<p>Look for things like:</p> 
<ul type=disc > 
<li ><strong >calories per serving</strong>&nbsp;(and what the serving size is—sometimes it's only part of the bottle or can)</li> 
<li ><strong >caffeine</strong></li> 
<li ><strong >artificial sweeteners</strong></li> 
<li ><strong >sugar</strong>&nbsp;(and sneaky terms for sugar, such as &quot;cane juice&quot;, &quot;syrup&quot;, glucose-fructose, etc.)</li> 
<li ><strong >alcohol</strong></li> 
<li ><strong >flavoring</strong>&nbsp;(even if it's &quot;natural flavor&quot;)</li> 
<li ><strong >coloring</strong></li> 
<li ><strong >preservatives</strong></li> 
<li ><strong >&quot;from concentrate&quot;</strong></li> 
<li ><strong >sodium</strong></li> 
<li ><strong >other stuff you're not sure you should be eating</strong>, like titanium dioxide</li> 
</ul> 
<p>Even drinks advertised as &quot;healthy&quot; are typically highly processed, which strips most of their valuable nutrients away.</p> 
<p>Unless you actually see someone squeezing an orange or putting an apple into a juicer, there's probably a big factory between you and the fruit tree.</p> 
<p><strong >The calories in drinks adds up</strong>. Here's an example. Even half this intake would add nearly 700 extra calories.</p> 
</section>
<section id="ember116" ><figure > 
<div class='figure'><img src='D:\PE\Procoach\Nutrition\Resource\img\bfe1e322-d52d-436d-b933-39f51b0d9a0b.jpg' width=100%></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>1370 empty calories that you don't need or want.</p>

<section id="ember117" > 
<h1 >It's your call.</h1> 
<p>You know your body, goals, choices and priorities better than anyone. You get to decide how to roll. What's worth it to you? Why?</p> 
<p>For instance,</p> 
<ul type=disc > 
<li >&quot;I like a nice glass of wine with dinner. I enjoy the taste and it helps me unwind and connect with my spouse.&quot;</li> 
<li >&quot;No alcohol for me tonight. I have an early morning workout.&quot;</li> 
</ul> 
<p>Each of these cases simply prioritizes different values—stress relief, taste, and social connection; or recovery and performance. They're both equally acceptable in context of those known priorities and tradeoffs.</p> 
<p><strong >Try experimenting.</strong></p> 
<p>Build more awareness of your daily choices. Push the edge of your familiar routines.</p> 
<p><strong >Before you drink, think.</strong></p> 
<p>Ask yourself if what you’re about to consume adds value to your body.</p> 
<p>If so, enjoy.</p> 
<p>If not, think about it and consider why you’re making that choice.</p> 
<p>This isn’t about &quot;good&quot; or &quot;bad&quot;. It's about learning to pay attention to your decisions. And then making the conscious choice to nourish yourself.</p> 
<p><strong >Notice and name.</strong></p> 
<p>Notice where this raised awareness or shifted choices messes up your routine. Where do you feel resistance?</p> 
<p>Alternatively, where does it feel comfortable and natural? Maybe it's already easy, and you could just do a bit more. Notice that too.</p> 
<p>How satisfied (or not) are you feeling with your drinks? How hungry or full do you feel afterwards?</p> 
<p>Be curious to find answers.</p>
