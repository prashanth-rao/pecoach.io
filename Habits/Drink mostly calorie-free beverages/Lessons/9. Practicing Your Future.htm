<p>Visualization creates a compelling, holistic image, and taps into deeper parts of the brain — the parts that deal with deeply meaningful gut-level stuff. Visualization can make change easier.</p>
<p><strong >It's the tool of the pros.</strong></p>
<p>Athletes and other performers use visualization to imagine — in detail — the point at which they'll inevitably get stuck or have trouble.</p>
<p>Then, they imagine how they'll work through those challenges. They practice problem solving in the brain before they even move a muscle.</p>
<p><strong >Their brain makes it &quot;real&quot; first. In turn, those thoughts have real biological effects in the body and future behavior.</strong></p>
<p>On game day, visualization has prepared the pro on how to best deal with all predictable outcomes.</p>

<p>Start by imagining a vivid &quot;film&quot; of dinner with your extended family.</p>
<p>It's a holiday. Everyone's there. Mom, Dad, Grandpappy, Nonna or Bubbie, Great-Aunt Mabel, little Jim-Bob, Bubbles the dog…</p>
<p>Whoever it is for you, put them around the table. You can smell the food and feel the lace doilies and plastic slipcovers on the furniture.</p>
<p>Now, while these folks mean well, they do get on your case about your eating habits, or pressure you to eat more.</p>
<p>Someone is going to bust your hump about why you aren't married, why you have to dress like a dang hippie, or how you're raising your kids all wrong.</p>
<p>And there's bound to be a lot of temptations — perhaps &quot;red-light foods&quot; or foods that upset your stomach, or booze that ensures you make poor choices after a couple of drinks.</p>
<p>You're anxious. It's go time.</p>
<p><strong >Before that scenario happens, use visualization to prepare.</strong></p>
<p>1. Create a rich picture first. Imagine the situation clearly.</p>
<p>2. Imagine the challenges that will pop up. Make them as real as possible.</p>
<p>3. Imagine yourself overcoming the challenges and handling them confidently and capably. Imagine using the skills of problem solving and resilience you <em >already</em> have.</p>
<p>4. Imagine the calm, unfrazzled words you'll use in response to unwanted offerings. You are unflappable.</p>
<p>5. Imagine yourself finishing the evening feeling great — you made good choices and stayed true to your goals and values. You feel satisfied — not wasted, bloated, or resentful.</p>
<p>Winning.</p>
<p>Next time you hit that holiday gathering, you'll have fully rehearsed your problem solving several times, and be ready for the challenge.</p>
<p>The best part about visualization? You always carry it with you. It works anywhere.</p>

<h1 >Practice your game.</h1>
<p>Today, think of a scenario that challenges you. Maybe that's:</p>
<ul type=disc >
<li >working out when you're tired</li>
<li >doing a lift that's tough or scary</li>
<li >coming home hungry and late from work</li>
</ul>
<p><strong >Imagine your scenario clearly beforehand.</strong></p>
<p><strong >Then imagine working through it creatively and productively.</strong></p>
<p>Imagine the whole thing in detail from beginning to successful end. &quot;Practice&quot; it as many times as you like. Tweak and adjust the &quot;film&quot; as you need to.</p>
<p>You can even associate &quot;triggers&quot; with the scenario, such as &quot;stay on track&quot;. When you say &quot;stay on track&quot; to yourself, it'll immediately conjure up your successful imagery.</p>
</section>
<section id="ember120" >
<h1 >Visualization isn't a guarantee.</h1>
<p>No one can ever prepare for anything perfectly.</p>
<p>That's why the goal isn't to be perfect. The goal is to be better, and, like all skills, visualization improves with practice.</p>
<p>To practice,</p>
<ul type=disc >
<li >Imagine yourself being resilient, capable, and creative,</li>
<li >Imagine specific solutions to problems that predictably pop up in particular situations.</li>
</ul>
<p>You'll still need both skill and luck to get to your goals. With consistent practice in visualization, you may notice your chances of good luck dramatically improving.</p>
