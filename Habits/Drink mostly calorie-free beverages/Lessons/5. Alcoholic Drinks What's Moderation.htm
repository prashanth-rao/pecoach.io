<section id="ember108" >Alcoholic drinks: What's &quot;moderation&quot;?</h1> 
<p>Whether it's a glass of wine with dinner or a few beers with friends on a sunny patio after work, drinking alcohol in moderation can have a worthy place in a balanced, healthy diet.</p> 
<p>So … what is&nbsp;<em >&quot;moderation&quot;</em>?</p> 
<p>&quot;Moderation&quot; is unique to each individual. Understanding moderation to any potentially addictive behavior involves two key variables:</p> 
<ul type=disc > 
<li >A general guideline of&nbsp;<em >amount</em>&nbsp;(e.g., less than three drinks per week),</li> 
<li >Your emotional&nbsp;<em >relationship</em>&nbsp;to that behavior (e.g., does drinking even a small amount of alcohol in certain situations make you more uncomfortable? Feeling out of control? Or regretful?)</li> 
</ul> 
<p>If you're considering your&nbsp;<em >relationship</em>&nbsp;to alcohol, you could ask yourself:</p> 
<p><strong >Can you go without your regular alcoholic drinks for two weeks without feeling uncomfortable?</strong></p> 
<p>If not, then you may not be drinking in moderation. Alcohol may be a coping mechanism for other unaddressed problems.</p>

<h1 >Relationships with coping</h1> 
<p><strong >Life is stressful. Everyone needs healthy ways to calm down and find comfort.</strong></p> 
<p>Some ways can be a win-win for both relieving stress and moving you towards your goals. A good run outside in the sunshine, or a blast-the-music session of smashing a punching bag, can usually kill a bad mood.</p> 
<p>Other ways of coping could be set on auto-pilot and less helpful. Like scrolling social media for hours, shopping, glazing over in front of TV.</p> 
<p>For any type of coping activity, if it’s not done thoughtfully and intentionally, it could be making problems worse.</p> 
<p>Alcohol is commonly used as a coping strategy. It’s a sedative that really can &quot;take the edge off&quot; or chill you out. It eases inhibitions and anxieties to grease the wheels of social interaction.</p>

<h1 >How do you know the line?</h1> 
<p>When is alcohol just part of a normal &quot;fit person&quot; lifestyle, and when is it a problem?</p> 
<p><strong >If the idea of giving up booze even for a short time is freaking you out… that's a red flag.</strong></p> 
<p>A few more important questions to understand your relationship with alcohol:</p> 
<ul type=disc > 
<li >Is alcohol an important part of me living a healthy life? Why?</li> 
<li >What am I using alcohol for? Does it feel uncomfortable to&nbsp;<em >not</em>&nbsp;drink? Why?</li> 
<li >What's a reasonable amount for me to drink? How many times per year (or month or week)?</li> 
<li >In what situations is it smart for me to drink? Which situations is it smarter for me to not drink?</li> 
<li >Does my drinking have any relationship to my food and eating habits? If so, what?</li> 
</ul> 
<p><strong >You can use this practice as a way to tune in to your experiences with alcohol. Are there other uncovered problems that alcohol has been keeping you from facing?</strong></p> 
</section>
<section id="ember111" > 
<h1 >If you need help, reach out.</h1> 
<p><strong >If you think you might need help with your drinking, get that help.</strong></p> 
<p>You're not a weirdo, you're not bad, and you're not alone. It’s very common to struggle with this.</p> 
<p>If this could apply to you, addressing a major obstacle like disordered drinking habits could set-off a cascade of progress. Settling anxiety around drinking could allow you to make huge progress elsewhere in your health journey much more easily.</p>
