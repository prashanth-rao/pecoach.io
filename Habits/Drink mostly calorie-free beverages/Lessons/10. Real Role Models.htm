<p>Pop media offers vivid imaginary worlds full of lifestyle perfection. Someday ... in a hazy, nebulous time and place … we'll look like the Insta famous celebrities, of negligible body fat and extreme race victories.</p>
<p><strong >Unless ... imagining a &quot;perfect&quot; future full of high achievement and accomplishment doesn't actually get us there.</strong></p>
<p>In fact, chasing impersonal ideals of perfection could be making us worse.</p>
<p>In a study that examined how people visualize their future, researchers compared two groups of people:</p>
<ul type=disc >
<li ><strong >Group 1</strong> visualized their future based on abstract, &quot;flawless&quot; images, such as magazines or movies.</li>
<li ><strong >Group 2</strong> found role models who were living the lives they wanted to live. They based their imaginary future on real, (flawed), people.</li>
</ul>
<p>Who ended up happier and more fulfilled? Group 2.</p>

<h1 >Using real-person role models makes us happier, because it's real.</h1>
<p><strong >When our role models are messy, complex, imperfect and real humans, they help us feel compassion for ourselves. They help us set much more realistic expectations.</strong></p>
<p>A primary characteristic of role models is that, in some way, they're &quot;better&quot; than us. They might be wiser, or more experienced, or more advanced than we are. They represent a part of something that we want to become, and haven't yet become.</p>
<p>Effective role models aren't unattainable or &quot;perfect&quot;. We can see for ourselves that they also confront challenges, screw up, and have bad hair days.</p>
<p><strong >Real-people role models also give us a clearer, more accurate vision of what to do or how to live.</strong></p>
<p>Rather than a magical fantasy that we'll always fail to accomplish, real-people role models give us a practical set of tools for managing life.</p>
<p>It's a lot more effective to think on a continuum, rather than of absolute perfection. It's more effective to imagine being <em >just a little bit better</em>.</p>

<h1 >Find a real-life role model.</h1>
<p><strong >Look around. Who's a real, &quot;imperfect&quot; health and fitness role model for you?</strong></p>
<p>Maybe that's a trainer or coach. Maybe that's someone in your gym.</p>
<p>Maybe it's your grandma who never misses her Aquafit class, or the neighbor you see out the window power-walking every morning.</p>
<p>Maybe that's even you on a superstar day.</p>

<section id="ember122" >
<h1 >Whoever it is, make the vision real.</h1>
<p>Let go of abstract, &quot;flawless&quot; images and find a real person living the active, healthy lifestyle you want to live.</p>
<p>Visualize yourself doing what that <em >real-life</em> role model person does, and feeling what they feel.</p>
<p>Visualize how they might confront challenges and overcome obstacles.</p>
<p>Visualize what they do in their average day — how they are committed to living a vibrant, nourishing, active, healthy lifestyle or dedicated to top athletic performance.</p>
<p>Visualize yourself moving just a little bit closer to that role model's lifestyle today.</p>
<p><strong >What's one real thing you can imagine doing to be a tiny bit better today?</strong></p>
