<h1 align=center >Letter to Your Old Self</h1> 
<h2 align=center >Get ready to write the most liberating breakup (or love) letter of your life.</h2> 
<p>Coach's Notes:&nbsp;A conscious &quot;break&quot; from the &quot;old self&quot;, whether an outright rejection, &quot;outgrowing&quot; the old self, or simply incorporating &quot;old self&quot; into &quot;new life&quot;.</p> 
<form > 
<h1 >
<section id="ember116" >Someone you are very close to may be going away soon.</h1> 
<p>Maybe it will be a loving farewell. Or, maybe you’ll sing &quot;I Will Survive&quot;, and kick them out the door.</p> 
<p>Maybe there will be tears. Or custody battles over who gets the beloved sweater or the philodendron. There might even be some dignity-shredding pleading or drunken phone calls at 3 a.m.</p> 
<p>Regardless of how sloppy it gets, persevere.</p> 
<p>Because ...</p> 
<p><strong >That someone is Old You: The person you used to be.</strong></p> 
<p>Old You worked well for you, at one point.</p> 
<p>But like an expired lover who's now snoring and farting in dirty underwear on the couch, it's time for that self to evolve and move on.</p> 
</section>
<section id="ember117" > 
<h1 >Grow past Old You.</h1> 
<p><strong >Write a letter to Old You.</strong></p> 
<p>You might imagine that you are bidding Old You goodbye.</p> 
<p><em >Dear Old Me:</em></p> 
<p><em >We've had some good times, haven't we? All that chocolate cake and wine?</em></p> 
<p><em >I used to think you were really a blast. You sure could rip through a buffet! Ha ha!</em></p> 
<p><em >But Old Me, I think we need to spend some time apart. You're hurting me.</em></p> 
<p><em >I've been seeing other people… fit people. And I've realized that we don't really have good chemistry anymore. (I'm talking about my blood chemistry, of course. I don't think my cholesterol is compatible with your habits.)</em></p> 
<p><em >I used to think that I couldn't be myself without you.</em></p> 
<p><em >Now I know I can — and better.</em></p> 
<p><em >Please leave the key under the mat, and take the party-sized potato chip bag with you.</em></p> 
<p><em >Thanks,</em></p> 
<p><em >New Me</em></p> 
<p>Give Old You a hug, tell them that their job is done, and send them on their way.</p> 
<p>(Change the locks, just in case.)</p> 
</section>
<section id="ember118" > 
<h1 >Each breakup is unique.</h1> 
<p>Sometimes Old You just needs to get thrown out in a clean breakup.</p> 
<p><strong >More often, Old You really does still love you.</strong></p> 
<p>Often, Old You is the part of your brain that's protecting or trying to help you in some way, even though there’s misguided efforts.</p> 
<p>Old You may be like a soldier still fighting battles that ended a long time ago. They're still out on the front lines, bravely defending you. Nobody told them the war was over.</p> 
</section>

<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Old You might even be Little You, a child-self who got &quot;stuck&quot; in an earlier behavior pattern, and stayed bravely at their post, never getting the memo that it was time to let go and grow up.</p> 
</section>
<section id="ember121" > 
<p>You might find that being compassionate works better than being angry.</p> 
<p>You might find that instead of breaking up with Old You, you simply…&nbsp;<em >absorb</em>&nbsp;Old You, keeping all their best features with you.</p> 
<p>You might tell them how much you love the New, more wise You.</p> 
<p><strong >&quot;Try on&quot; different messages to Old You, and see what resonates.</strong></p> 
<p>It may be &quot;go away&quot;. It may be &quot;thank you&quot;. It may be &quot;I love you and I'm sorry.&quot;</p> 
<p>Experiment and see what works for you.</p> 
<p>Remember that Old You probably had some reason to be there. Old You may even be Child You.</p> 
<p>Be gentle and loving, and firm.</p> 
<p>This is&nbsp;<em >your</em>&nbsp;letter. This is&nbsp;<em >your</em>&nbsp;You.</p> 
<p>So make it work for all your Yous.</p>
