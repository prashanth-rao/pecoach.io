<p>Coach's Notes:&nbsp;How to improve intake by making a great cup of coffee or tea. An additive approach -- adding good stuff rather than taking &quot;bad stuff&quot; away.</p>

<section id="ember116" >Should you consume caffeine?</h1> 
<p>It depends.</p> 
<p><strong >Our ability to tolerate caffeine is partly genetic.</strong></p> 
<p>Some people are &quot;fast metabolizers&quot;, meaning they process caffeine effectively and it isn't as likely to cause health complications.</p> 
<p>Others are &quot;slow metabolizers&quot;. In excess, caffeine can increase their risk of disease.</p> 
<p>In general, most who drink about 1 to 3 small cups of coffee or about 2 to 4 cups of regular black tea won't experience any significant disruptions.</p> 
<p><strong >Whether caffeine is a smart option also depends on lifestyle factors.</strong></p> 
<p>Many people find that caffeine worsens carb cravings or hypoglycemia symptoms. If you find yourself jittery and sugar-jonesing an hour or two after a coffee, consider drinking less coffee, or cutting it with decaf.</p> 
<p>For some, caffeine may worsen other conditions, such as anxiety. For women, it may worsen unwelcome symptoms of menopause, such as hot flashes.</p>

<h1 >Considering coffee?</h1> 
<p>The flavor of black coffee can be intense. If you're already a fan of black coffee, you might appreciate it for a rich, nuanced taste. There's a hint of acidity, almost a sourness in some blends.</p> 
<p>If you're used to a coffee-type drink that's more like liquid chocolate cake, trying black coffee can be kind of a hairy experience at first. If you're interested in much lower-calorie options, going black could be worth it.</p> 
<p>Sensitizing to the subtle complexity of black coffee can take time. It can be a practice in appreciating finer qualities. Ultimately, it's an example of making a tradeoff for&nbsp;<em >better</em>, rather than deprivation.</p> 
<p>Black coffee is just one example. There are many finer-quality, lower-calorie options to find. To experiment, try consuming&nbsp;<em >less</em>&nbsp;in terms of calories, and&nbsp;<em >more</em>&nbsp;in terms of quality and experience.</p>

<p><strong >Make it better</strong></p> 
<p>Today, why not treat yourself to a really awesome cup of coffee?</p> 
<p>Here are some options.</p> 
<ul type=disc > 
<li >Check out your local independent coffee shop. Ask for recommendations.</li> 
<li >Buy slightly better-quality beans than you're used to, and grind them fresh at home.</li> 
<li >If you're one of those people who's already a coffee aficionado and loves precision and chemistry experiments, try these tips for&nbsp;<a href="https://nategreen.org/how-to-make-the-perfect-cup-of-coffee/" target="_blank" >how to make the perfect cup of coffee</a>.</li>

<h1 >Considering tea?</h1> 
<p>After being plucked from the&nbsp;<em >Camellia sinensis</em>&nbsp;plant, tea is fermented and processed.</p> 
<p>The more processing (heating and drying) the tea leaves undergo, the darker they turn.</p> 
<ul type=disc > 
<li >Green tea and white tea are the least processed tea</li> 
<li >Black and oolong teas are partially dried, crushed, and fermented.</li> 
</ul> 
<p>Regardless of the processing method, black, green, white and oolong teas all contain health-promoting polyphenols.</p> 
<p>In fact, tea ranks as high as or higher than many fruits and vegetables in the ORAC score, a score that measures antioxidant potential of plant-based foods.</p> 
<p>Thus, tea has many health benefits, plus about half the caffeine of coffee.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong >Make it better</strong></p> 
<p>Start with loose tea. Tea bags usually contain lower quality &quot;dust&quot; tea, a sort of waste product left over from sorting the higher quality loose leaf tea.</p> 
<p>(Of course, if you have bags, you can still use them. But loose leaf is better stuff, so consider upgrading!)</p> 
<p>There are literally hundreds of tea blends out there. Check out places like&nbsp;<a href="https://www.teavana.com/" target="_blank" >Teavana</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.republicoftea.com/" target="_blank" >The Republic of Tea</a>, or&nbsp;<a href="https://www.davidstea.com/" target="_blank" >David's Tea</a>.</p> 
<p>Dessert teas are often a nice substitute for something sweet after a meal. Double-check ingredients, as manufacturers often use sugar or artificial flavors, even in &quot;natural&quot; products.</p>

<h1 >Whatever you choose, drink it better.</h1> 
<p>There's a reason that a traditional Japanese tea ceremony is a careful, slow experience: It asks us to pause during our busy day and enjoy the details of the moment.</p> 
<p><strong >With your next cup of coffee or tea, try taking a few extra minutes to slow down.</strong></p> 
<p>Pause. Breathe.</p> 
<p>Sniff the coffee or tea. Taste it. Savor it.</p> 
<p>Watch the steam rise.</p> 
<p>If you're trying something new, be curious. What's it like? How does the flavor change from start to finish?</p> 
<p><strong >Rather than seeking a quick hit of caffeine, consider using coffee or tea drinking to step briefly out of your busy day and into a moment of calm and focus.</strong></p> 
<p><i>Drink your tea slowly and reverently, as if it is the axis on which the world earth revolves—slowly, evenly, without rushing toward the future.<br > —Thích Nh&#7845;t H&#7841;nh</i></p>
