<section id="ember112" >Clear the clutter.</h1>
<p><strong >One way you can use visualization is to do a &quot;mental makeover&quot;.</strong></p>
<p>Think of this sort of like the brain equivalent of one of those home-makeover reality TV shows.</p>
<p>If your head was a room and you walked inside, how does it look? Clean and organized? Or like a house on Hoarders?</p>

<p><strong >If you're feeling the clutter, try organizing one corner.</strong></p>
<p>Visualization can help.</p>

<h1 >Shut your eyes and visualize your &quot;mental attic&quot;.</h1>
<p>Of all the clutter that was loved one day: the ancient yearbooks, stacks of moldy board games and creepy one-eyed dolls.</p>
<p><strong >Start by creating a vivid, rich picture of your imaginary &quot;mental attic&quot;.</strong></p>
<ul type=disc >
<li >What's in there?</li>
<li >What does it look like? smell like?</li>
<li >Can you feel the gritty dust under your feet? What’s that?</li>
</ul>
<p>Spend a bit of time building this image until you can experience it clearly.</p>
<p><strong >Look around.</strong></p>
<p>You're looking for something in particular.</p>
<p>It's a box labeled <em >Things That Are Holding Me Back</em>.</p>
<p>Maybe there are several boxes. (Luckily you labeled them when you stored them up here.)</p>
<p><strong >These boxes are full of things that are preventing you from moving forward with your journey in deep health and body transformation.</strong></p>
<p>Like, maybe ...</p>
<ul type=disc >
<li >an old photo, of someone in fifth grade calling you &quot;fat&quot;.</li>
<li >a memory of falling down in gym class, or being picked last for a game.</li>
<li >there's a photo of you in great shape, something you never thought you could achieve again.</li>
<li >one of your negative &quot;inner critics&quot; — the voice in your head that reminds you about all the ways you suck.</li>
<li >an outfit you wore when you were younger, and you're convinced you'll never fit into it again.</li>
<li >an old diary or notebook in which you wrote all your excuses for not doing things.</li>
</ul>
<p>Whatever it is, dig in the imaginary box. Pull out one thing that you know is holding you back.</p>
<p><strong >Imagine yourself walking to a trash can, and throwing that thing out.</strong></p>
<p>It's gone.</p>
<p><strong >Pause to enjoy the relief and freedom.</strong></p>
<p>You're free of one more little piece of mental junk that held you back.</p>
<p><strong >Notice how it feels to let that thing go.</strong></p>
