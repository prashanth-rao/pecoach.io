<h1 align=center >Think Before You Drink</h1> 
<h2 align=center >Make each drink a conscious choice, rather than a mindless one.</h2> 
<p>Coach's Notes:&nbsp;Explains rationale for habit; asks clients to simply consider whether their drink choices are helping them move towards their goals.</p>

<section id="ember111" >Are the calories that you're drinking making you better?</h1> 
<p>To bring more attention to the quality of what you're drinking, start with a couple of key questions.</p> 
<p><strong >Do the calories you're drinking …</strong></p> 
<ul type=disc > 
<li >Add value to your body and life? Or detract value?</li> 
<li >Make your body, performance, and/or recovery better? Or worse?</li> 
</ul> 
<p>To experiment, slow down. Pause before you drink to consider those questions. Aim to make the next beverage you drink a conscious, deliberate choice towards your goals, rather than automatic.</p>

<section id="ember112" > 
<h1 >Add water</h1> 
<p>To move along the continuum of better, try substituting water for your normal calorie-containing beverages (such as juice or Gatorade) to stay hydrated.</p> 
<p>Make it easy for yourself:</p> 
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong >Start your morning with a glass of water.</strong></p> 
<p>Leave an empty glass on your bathroom sink so you'll see it when you wake up in the morning. Before you jump in the shower, fill the glass and drink.</p> 
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong >Sip water between bites of food.</strong></p> 
<p>This will also help you slow your eating, and eat more consciously.</p> 
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong >Buy a slick water bottle and carry it with you.</strong></p> 
<p>Or recycle a glass bottle or jar.</p> 
</section>
<section id="ember113" > 
<h1 >Make choices on a continuum</h1> 
<p><strong >The practice of exploring no-calorie beverages is a game of pushing boundaries and building awareness.</strong></p> 
<p>It's not a set of rules, or restrictions on what's good or bad.</p> 
<p>It's a game for you to figure out how to move along your continuum, according to what &quot;a little bit better&quot; is for&nbsp;<em >you</em>.</p> 
<p><strong >Keep it small and simple</strong></p> 
<p>Play with this experiment one small step at a time, and slowly level-up your no-calorie-beverage skills.</p> 
<p>For example:</p> 
<ul type=disc > 
<li >If you normally have a double-cream coffee, try cutting to one cream or using homogenized milk instead.</li> 
<li >If you normally have a full-fat latte, try a skim milk latte or just a regular coffee.</li> 
<li >If you normally have regular soda, try a diet soda. If you normally drink diet soda, try soda water with some lemon or lime.</li> 
<li >If you normally have 3 glasses of wine in the evening, cut it to 1 or 2 glasses.</li> 
<li >If you're looking for something a little tougher, try cold turkey on caloric drinks.</li> 
</ul>

<section id="ember114" > 
<h1 >It's up to you.</h1> 
<p>Whatever you choose…</p> 
<p><strong >Experiment with being a calorie-free drinker.</strong></p> 
<p>Try it. Explore substitutions and small changes. Challenge yourself, if you want. Observe what happens.</p> 
<p>Observe where you get annoyed, irritated, or resistant. (Like,&nbsp;<em >&quot;Nobody's gonna take away my beer!&quot;</em>)</p> 
<p>Likewise, see where you can stretch or nudge into small changes. If you practice&nbsp;<em >consistently</em>, over time those small changes accumulate to major progress.</p>
