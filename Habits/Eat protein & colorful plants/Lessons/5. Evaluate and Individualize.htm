<p>Coach's Notes:&nbsp;Further shifting the burden of analysis and evaluation to the client—what data has been gathered; what patterns surface; what next steps does this imply?</p>

<section id="ember117" >Start tailoring your nutrition plan to&nbsp;<em >you</em></h1> 
<p>When it comes to nutrition, here are two basic principles.</p> 
<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp; Everyone is the same.</p> 
<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp; Everyone is different.</p> 
<p>Well, that clears up the confusion...</p> 
</section>
<section id="ember118" > 
<h1 >Everyone is the same</h1> 
<p>Human physiology works pretty much the same for everyone.</p> 
</section>

<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>For example, unlike deep-sea-dwelling anaerobic bacteria living around volcanic vents, humans breathe oxygen instead of methane. Unlike a cow, humans have just one stomach and they can't eat grass.</p> 
<p>In coaching, everyone starts off the same: at step one, doing one thing at a time.</p> 
<p>No matter the level of knowledge an individual has when they start, the fundamental process and principles are the same.</p> 
</section>
<section id="ember121" > 
<h1 >Coaching fundamentals</h1> 
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Do one thing at a time.</p> 
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Eat a variety of real, whole, unprocessed foods that add value to your body.</p> 
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To lose fat, eat a little bit less.</p> 
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Make sure your overall eating environment, practices and mindset help you rather than hinder you.</p> 
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Aim for consistent and &quot;pretty good&quot; every day, rather than extreme swings from rigid or &quot;perfect&quot; and uncontrolled or chaotic.</p> 
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Make minimum commitments to new practices. Do them consistently for at least 2 weeks before making any changes, to determine how it's working for you.</p> 
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Your body reflects what you put into it (food, recovery) and take out of it (activity, stress).</p> 
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Be an expert of your experience. Make decisions based on data, close observation of yourself, and your goals. Rather than rules or someone else's plan for you.</p> 
<p>Mastering these fundamentals and practicing them consistently is what leads to mastery.</p> 
</section>
<section id="ember122" > 
<h1 >Everyone is different</h1> 
<p>While it's mostly right to say that people are fundamentally the same, there are for sure important preferences and variables that make us unique. Those unique characteristics show up in both people, foods, and our relationship between them.</p> 
<p>For example, maybe...</p> 
<ul type=disc > 
<li >Some foods make you feel better than others.</li> 
<li >Some foods don't make you feel very good at all (especially if you have a food sensitivity, intolerance, or allergy).</li> 
<li >You feel better with more or less fat, more or less meat, cooked vegetables instead of fresh, different types of carbohydrates, and so forth.</li> 
<li >Some foods (or food environments, or situations) &quot;trigger&quot; you into behaviors that aren't healthy.</li> 
</ul> 
</section>
<section id="ember123" > 
<h1 >Keep it simple</h1> 
<p>Individualizing and refining&nbsp;<em >doesn’t</em>&nbsp;mean you get bogged down in tiny, probably irrelevant, details. It&nbsp;<em >doesn’t</em>&nbsp;mean spreadsheets and elaborate, restrictive plans.</p> 
<p>In fact,&nbsp;<strong >individualizing often means making things&nbsp;</strong><em ><b>simpler</b></em><strong>.</strong></p> 
<p>Getting down to the essence of what YOU need. What YOU can do in your real life.</p> 
<p>Simply&nbsp;<strong >make small, practical, and sustainable nutritional adjustments based on careful, thoughtful, informed self-awareness</strong>.</p> 
</section>
<section id="ember124" > 
<h1 >Steer dynamically</h1> 
<p>Think about how you drive a car.</p> 
</section>
<section id="ember125" ><figure > 
<div class='figure'><img src='D:\PE\Procoach\Nutrition\Resource\img\11f2e68a-4d18-468f-a1da-a1442f65d1ff.jpg' width=100%></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Do you crank the steering wheel in one direction and then leave it there for the entire trip? No, of course not.</p> 
<p>Even when you're driving in a perfectly straight line, you need to adjust the steering wheel to keep the car on course.</p> 
<p>And even if you're going along smoothly in a pretty clear direction, you still need to watch the road ahead and make small corrections and changes as needed.</p> 
<p>Occasionally you might need to stop, slow down, turn one way or another… or even back up and make a U-turn.</p> 
<p>The same ideas apply to eating and exercise.</p> 
<ul type=disc > 
<li >Start with a map or general plan (such as a nutrition program).</li> 
<li >Make small adjustments as necessary.</li> 
<li >Turn or backtrack when you need to.</li> 
<li >Work with the actual road conditions—YOUR body's unique response and needs.</li> 
</ul> 
</section>
<section id="ember127" > 
<h1 >How do you know what &quot;works&quot;?</h1> 
<p>Ask yourself:</p> 
<ul type=disc > 
<li >Do you feel good inside and out?</li> 
<li >Do you have lots of energy for what you want to do?</li> 
<li >Are your health indicators (e.g., blood chemistry, blood pressure, resting heart rate, immune system) good?</li> 
<li >Are you performing well in the gym?</li> 
<li >Are you meeting your goals?</li> 
</ul> 
<p>Ignore what you think you &quot;should&quot; do. Ignore other people's &quot;rules of the road&quot;.</p> 
<p><strong >Stay in&nbsp;</strong><em ><b>your</b></em><strong>&nbsp;lane, driving your car to&nbsp;</strong><em ><b>your</b></em><strong>&nbsp;destination.</strong></p> 
<p>Stay relaxed and moving in the right general direction.</p>
