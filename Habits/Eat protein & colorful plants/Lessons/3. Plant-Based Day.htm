<p>Being a scientist in your life means you base decisions on data and evidence, not feelings or subjective perceptions.</p>
<p>You observe, take careful notes, and then analyze and interpret the &quot;data&quot; to draw a conclusion.</p>

<p><strong >For one day, eat a balanced diet of protein and colorful vegetables that's exclusively plant-based.</strong></p>

<h1 >What's plant-based</h1>
<p>Plant-based includes:</p>
<ul type=disc >
<li >beans and legumes</li>
<li >nuts and seeds</li>
<li >grains</li>
<li >fruits and vegetables</li>
</ul>
<p>For protein, you'll have to rely primarily on the first three food groups (although many fruits and vegetables contain small amounts of protein, such as spirulina, mushrooms, some leafy greens, apricots, and peaches).</p>
<p>Nuts and seeds contain protein, and also plenty of fat. High fat also means high calories. Use those energy-dense foods sparingly.</p>
<p>Higher-protein choices include:</p>
<ul type=disc >
<li >lentils</li>
<li >beans</li>
<li >soy products, such as tofu, tempeh and soy milk</li>
<li >soybeans (edamame)</li>
<li >peanut flour</li>
<li >natural peanut butter (use very sparingly)</li>
<li >other nuts and nut butters (use very sparingly)</li>
<li >higher-protein whole grains, such as steel-cut oats or whole oat groats, wild or brown rice, amaranth, quinoa and buckwheat</li>
</ul>

<p>If you’d like to learn more about which plant products are higher in protein, use <a href="http://nutritiondata.self.com/tools/nutrientsearch" target="_blank" >NutritionData’s nutrient search tool</a>.</p>
<p>Search &quot;protein&quot; and the food group you want to explore.</p>
<p>You can also include a plant-based protein powder, such as:</p>
<ul type=disc >
<li >hemp seed protein powder</li>
<li >pea protein</li>
<li >pumpkin seed protein</li>
<li >a mixed vegan blend such as Vega or Vegan proteins+</li>
<li >brown rice protein</li>
<li >spirulina</li>
</ul>
<p>Check out your local health food store. Many will have individual protein powder packets for sale, so you can grab a couple for today without having to commit to an entire tub.</p>
</section>
<section id="ember127" >
<h1 >What's not plant-based</h1>
<p>A plant-based day excludes meat, fish, and poultry. It also excludes less-obvious animal-food sources like:</p>
<ul type=disc >
<li >eggs</li>
<li >dairy (cheese, yogurt, whey protein, milk, cream, butter, etc.)</li>
</ul>
<p>Also be aware that &quot;plant-based&quot; doesn’t always translate to “healthy”. Lots of junk food is &quot;plant-based&quot;, as is sugar and other sweeteners such as agave or dried dates.</p>
<p>As always, read labels and be a skeptical consumer.</p>

<h1 >What's on your lab clipboard?</h1>
<p>Smart and useful experiments are a matter of taking accurate notes.</p>
<p>At the end of your plant-based day, ask yourself a couple of questions:</p>
<p>1. How did I feel eating this way?</p>
<p>o Do I feel good inside and out?</p>
<p>o Do I have lots of energy for what I want to do?</p>
<p>o Are my health indicators (e.g., blood pressure, resting heart rate) good?</p>
<p>o Am I performing well in the gym?</p>
<p>o Am I meeting my goals?</p>
<p>2. What does this experience teach me about myself and what works for me?</p>
<p>o Apply what you learned and adjust your long-term intake. Can you be more creative with different types of plants in your diet?</p>
