<p>Are you satisfied with your knowledge of veggie variety? Enough to keep you interested and excited about eating them every day?</p>

<h1 >Learning to cook, for more spice &amp; variety</h1>
<p>Often, the solution to liking or being interested in something is to learn about it.</p>
<p><strong >Learn to cook. Or learn to cook better.</strong></p>
<p>Be adventurous in the supermarket and the kitchen.</p>
<p>When you know how to choose, prepare, and cook a wide variety of foods, the world is your oyster. You aren't doomed to the same few options.</p>
<p>You can go anywhere and do anything, confident in the knowledge that whatever green thing lands in your grocery cart or on your dinner plate... you can handle it.</p>
<p>Below are a few ways of preparing vegetables and maybe some novel adventures with vegetables.</p>
</section>
<section id="ember129" >
<h1 >Grilling and broiling</h1>
<p>Nothing adds a wild flavor to food like grilling it over an open flame. If you don't have an outdoor grill, you can use your oven's broiler.</p>
<p>You can grill nearly anything. Brush the food with a little olive oil and keep a close eye on it (especially if you're broiling, because things crisp up quickly).</p>
<ul type=disc >
<li >tomatoes (slice in half and grill the skin side, or broil on a cookie sheet)</li>
<li >eggplant (slice in 1&quot;-thick slices)</li>
<li >fennel</li>
<li >peppers</li>
<li >avocado</li>
<li >asparagus</li>
<li >Portabello mushrooms</li>
<li >zucchini</li>
<li >butternut squash</li>
</ul>
<p>Fruit works, too! Pineapple, mangoes, and apples all grill well.</p>
<p>For even more smoky flavor over a gas grill, place wood chips (e.g., cedar) in a small pan on the grill. Preheat the grill for a few minutes until the chips are smoking. Then add your food of choice and keep the lid closed.</p>

<p> </p>
<h1 >Braising</h1>
<p>Braising is cooking food that's partially covered by a little bit of liquid.</p>
<p>One great option for liquid is chicken or veggie stock. You can also use water, unsweetened fruit or vegetable juices (such as tomato juice), balsamic vinegar, or a little bit of dry wine or sherry (or a combination).</p>
<p>Braising slowly tenderizes vegetables (or meats) and adds a lot of flavor without added fat. This is particularly useful for tougher, more fibrous vegetables such as celery, carrots, beets, cabbage, and parsnips.</p>
<p>To braise, pour your vegetables into a pan on the stove. Add enough liquid to just barely cover them. Cook them over medium-low heat so that they simmer rather than boil.</p>
<p>Braising also combines well with deglazing.</p>
</section>
<section id="ember132" >
<h1 >Deglazing</h1>
<p>Ever noticed that when you sauté something like meat in a pan, it leaves a bunch of browned bits behind? No frowns and steel wool.</p>
<p>Instead, deglaze. Keep the heat on, pour in a bit of liquid, then let the liquid simmer as you scrape up the browned bits.</p>
<p>Those browned bits are a result of the Maillard reaction, which happens when heat caramelizes proteins and sugars. They add the intangible &quot;yum&quot; factor of <em >umami</em>, or savoriness.</p>
<p>Start with sautéing some meat and/or veggies in a bit of fat such as butter or coconut oil. Cook over medium-high heat until the food browns.</p>
<p>Pour in some liquid, stir, and get scraping. Keep cooking until some of the water evaporates and you have a nice thick sauce.</p>

<p> </p>
<p>Chop them finely and toss them in with the greens.</p>
<p>Use a handful or two of herbs like:</p>
<ul type=disc >
<li >basil</li>
<li >oregano</li>
<li >chives</li>
<li >mint</li>
<li >sorrel</li>
<li >thyme</li>
<li >marjoram</li>
<li >chervil</li>
<li >tarragon</li>
<li >cilantro</li>
<li >dill</li>
<li >fennel tops</li>
</ul>
<p>The brightest flavor and nutrients will be from whatever's in peak season in your area at the time.</p>
