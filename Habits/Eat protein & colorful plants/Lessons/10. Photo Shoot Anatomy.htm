<section id="ember119" >A pro shoot, from the model’s perspective.</h1>
<p>Have you ever looked at the cover of a fitness magazine and thought, &quot;I want to look like <em >that</em>&quot;?</p>
<p>That's part of the point of the advertising. The people and bodies are enchanting—cheese-grater abs, perky butts, and a glowing smile all the time.</p>
<p>Are those ripped fitness images on magazine covers real? How much does the wizardry of modern photography and Photoshop come into play?</p>
<p>There are two important ideas to understand of professional commercial photo shoots:</p>
<p><strong >Most commercial media images of &quot;fitness&quot; are not &quot;real&quot;.</strong></p>
<p>They're highly constructed. They're used to sell things, or show a very brief moment in time (such as a bodybuilding competition). Advertising images like that are <em >not</em> about health, athletic performance, or wellness.</p>
<p>Likewise, those ideals make for poor role models. Real-life people are much more practical and effective motivators.</p>
<p><strong >Commercial photo shoots enlist a team of experts to make the product—the model—look good.</strong></p>

<h1 >The commercial shoot: from the model's perspective</h1>
<p><strong >Step 1: Diet and training</strong></p>
<p>Think that professional fitness models and physique athletes just roll out of bed and on to the set or stage? Usually not.</p>
<p><strong >There are several weeks of careful, stringent dieting and hard training.</strong></p>
<p>Often, <em >everything</em> is carefully measured and recorded, down to the gram or minute or pound.</p>
<p><strong >Step 2: Grooming</strong></p>
<p><strong >Tanning</strong></p>
<p>A tan absorbs light, and makes body contours look leaner and more defined. Models will often tan (either outdoor or indoor) for a few weeks in advance, gradually building color. Then, they often use a bronzer for the shoot.</p>
<p>Then, at the shoot, models are either oiled up or sprayed with—wait for it!—PAM cooking spray. Shiny skin creates highlights and, again, makes muscles look more defined.</p>
<p><strong >Make-up</strong></p>
<p>Shoot makeup is a lot heavier than daily-wear makeup. For many shoots, models get the full drag-queen treatment: foundation, powder, lipstick, fake eyelashes, etc. Strong lights wash out normal makeup, so models have to layer on the warpaint. Then, on film, the makeup looks natural.</p>

<p> </p>
<p>And here’s a classic photo shoot trick: Preparation H. Yes, hemorrhoid cream. Works wonders on under-eye bags and circles. Who knew?</p>

<h1 >The shoot</h1>
<p>A pro shoot takes time. A team of stylists and designers is standing by to make sure the image looks just right. That means a lot of waiting around.</p>
<p>It's hard work. Imagine simultaneously sucking in your gut, flexing all your muscles, turning your shoulders one way and your hips the other way, while your outfit is taped and clamped and the smell of your bronzer is tickling your nose... and smiling.</p>
<p>Here's a video of Coach Krista Schaus, 4 weeks before a bodybuilding competition, practicing her posing.</p>

<p>1. <strong >A candid shot, 4 months before competition</strong></p>
<p>In this shot, Krista stands relaxed, under natural lighting.</p>
<p>2. <strong >A professional photo shoot, days before competition</strong></p>
<p>Stronger overhead lighting dramatically brings out her muscle definition. A plain background means we focus on the model, rather than what’s in her living room. Krista carefully poses to look &quot;natural&quot; while still flexing.</p>
<p>3. <strong >As &quot;Mystique&quot; from X-Men, after months of dieting plus several hours of hair and airbrushing</strong></p>
<p>Krista's posing technique and outfit change the appearance of her body. (Well, that and the blue skin...)</p>
