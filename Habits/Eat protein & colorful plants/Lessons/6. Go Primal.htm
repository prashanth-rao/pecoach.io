<section id="ember118" >Ancestral dinners</h1> 
<p>It's dinner time. You're hanging out with friends and family after a nice day outside. The fresh evening air smells like wood smoke and grilled meat. The menu includes ribs, baked clams, succulent baby greens, and fresh berries with honey for dessert.</p> 
<p>Sounds like a night at your favorite East Coast restaurant. And then... you start scratching at your fleas and smashing meat off the bone with a rock.</p> 
<p>Tonight, you're partying like it's 19,999 BC.</p> 
<p>This is the so-called Paleo or Primal Diet.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<h1 >What does &quot;Paleo&quot; involve?</h1> 
<p>&quot;Paleo&quot; refers to the Paleolithic period, from the Greek root &quot;<em >palaio</em>&quot; or &quot;old&quot;, and &quot;<em >lithic</em>&quot;, or &quot;stone&quot;—literally, the Old Stone Age. This period extended from about 2.6 million to 10,000 years ago.</p> 
<p>There are two key ideas behind the theory of a Paleo or Primal Diet.</p> 
<p><strong >Idea 1: For most of human (or prehuman) history, we evolved and developed in an environment with certain types of foods.</strong></p> 
<p>These foods are:</p> 
<p><strong >Any animal, including:</strong></p> 
<ul type=disc > 
<li >any and all land and sea animals</li> 
<li >eggs</li> 
</ul> 
<p><strong >Almost any edible plants, including:</strong></p> 
<ul type=disc > 
<li >stems (such as rhubarb or celery)</li> 
<li >leaves (such as spinach or seaweed)</li> 
<li >roots and tubers (such as carrots or turnips)</li> 
<li >fruits (such as berries, olives, or figs)</li> 
<li >seeds that can be eaten raw (such as nuts or coconuts)</li> 
</ul> 
<p><strong >Honey and any other naturally occurring plant sugars</strong>&nbsp;(such as raw maple sap or sugar cane).</p> 
<p><strong >In other words, early humans ate only what they could hunt or gather.</strong></p> 
<p>Although modern-type humans nailed the fire concept pretty early on, they didn’t figure out fancy cooking skills or agriculture until much later.</p> 
<p>That means that they&nbsp;<em >didn't</em>&nbsp;consume:</p> 
<ul type=disc > 
<li >modern grains (nor were the available grains as large and easily acquired as they are now),</li> 
<li >seeds, such as beans or legumes, that required cooking,</li> 
<li >processed sugars (most regions didn't have fruit year-round, nor were most fruits as sweet as they are now),</li> 
<li >processed dairy, such as cheese.</li> 
</ul> 
</section>
<section id="ember121" > 
<p><strong >Idea 2: Because we've spent most of our evolution as a species consuming these particular foods, we function best when that's what we eat.</strong></p> 
<p>A skull found in Chad pushes the date of human origins back to 6 million years ago.</p> 
<p>In comparison, agriculture (which eventually included breeding and growing of grains) originated about 10,000 years ago.</p> 
<p>And high-fructose corn syrup (HFCS) has only been around since the late 1950s, while the latest artificial sweetener, Neotame, was approved by the FDA in 2002.</p> 
<p>In other words, in human evolutionary terms, we're not used to common newfangled modern food.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Advocates of ancestral diets suggest that modern foods, which were introduced relatively later in our development, are hard for us to process and digest. We simply haven't yet evolved the machinery to do it well.</p> 
<p>On the other hand, when we eat the whole, unprocessed foods from the list above (i.e., animals + most types of plants), we may be eating in a way that better fits human evolutionary structure and digestion.</p> 
<p>Research that looks at modern-day foragers who eat ancestral diets shows that these populations are free of many of the chronic &quot;diseases of civilization&quot; that plague modern societies now, such as diabetes, osteoporosis, tooth decay, and cardiovascular disease.</p> 
</section>
<section id="ember124" > 
<h1 >Variety</h1> 
<p>We know from anthropological evidence and studies of modern-day foragers that ancestral diets vary quite a lot. When you can't drive to a grocery store, you eat whatever is around you.</p> 
<p>For example:</p> 
<ul type=disc > 
<li >Arctic indigenous diets are high-fat, high-protein diets of land and sea animals such as whale, seal, reindeer/caribou and fish, with few vegetables or fruits. They get their vitamins from organ meats.</li> 
<li >Some indigenous African diets are mostly plant-based, high in starchy tubers and vegetables. Others are mostly animal-based, relying almost exclusively on cow's meat, milk, and blood.</li> 
<li >Many indigenous diets included insects, snails, mice, snakes, and other small animals. Hey, big game hunting is tough work. Ya gotta eat something on the days you don't manage to grab a mammoth burger.</li> 
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Stone Age life was not for picky eaters. Early humans were omnivorous scavengers who'd consume darn near anything that wasn’t nailed down.</p> 
</section>
<section id="ember127" > 
<h1 >Keep it simple</h1> 
<p>Regardless of how any specific ancestral diet looked in practice, they all followed one very simple underlying principle:</p> 
<p><em >Eat only whole foods that you can catch, dig up, or gather.</em></p> 
<p>It's familiar advice.</p> 
</section>
<section id="ember128" > 
<h1 >Going primal</h1> 
<p>If you're interested, start thinking about some primal recipes or prep ideas that you might like to try. Or how you might adjust your daily menu to go 100% ancestral-style for a day.</p> 
<p>You may already be well accustomed to eating ancestral-style.</p> 
<p>For example:</p> 
<p>Meal 1 – Eggs scrambled with vegetables and a bit of coconut oil</p> 
<p>Meal 2 – Chicken coconut curry with vegetables</p> 
<p>Meal 3 – Turkey meatballs + salsa with avocado</p> 
<p>Meal 4 – Steak, salad with olive oil vinaigrette, and berries for dessert</p>
