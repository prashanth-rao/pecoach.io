<h1 >What's right for <em >you</em>?</h1>
<p>Humans are diverse.</p>
<p><strong >The only way to know unique, individual you is to tune in to what makes your unique body look, feel, and perform best.</strong></p>
<p>You can practice in many different ways.</p>
</section>
<section id="ember126" >
<h1 >Look for other people like you</h1>
<p>Look for similar body types and shapes, similar &quot;exercise personalities&quot;, similar activity levels or sports, etc.</p>
</section>
<section id="ember127" >
<h1 >Look for &quot;bright spots&quot;</h1>
<p>Notice and name when you are feeling good, full of energy, and successful. What factors contribute to this?</p>
<p>Look at where people like you are succeeding.</p>
<ul type=disc >
<li >Are you short? Take up weightlifting or gymnastics.</li>
<li >Are you tall? Kill it at rowing, basketball, or swimming.</li>
<li >Do you have long arms and legs? Hit the climbing wall.</li>
<li >Are you solid and heavy? Find yourself a boxing ring or throwing pit and make physics your friend.</li>
<li >Are you social? Take a class, have a dinner party, and/or do a team sport. Are you a lone wolf? Cool, hit the nature trails and enjoy the solitude.</li>
</ul>
<p>Keep your eyes peeled for options and opportunities.</p>

<h1 >Find your niche</h1>
<p>Feel like you &quot;should&quot; run, but you're tall and robust, and your knees kill you when you try it?</p>
<p>Forget running. Take up a sport that rewards your body type.</p>
<p>Feel like you &quot;should&quot; eat Food X (which makes you gag), because &quot;that's what healthy people eat&quot;? Meh. Try a few different ways to cook/prep it before you make a final decision (or try Food X as prepared by a skilled chef). Then if it's truly not your thing, cut it from the roster and find an alternative.</p>

<h1 >Be OK with being OK</h1>
<p>If you love a food or activity that isn't an ideal fit for you, no problem. Enjoy it. Just accept that your relationship might be imperfect at times. Practice being OK with being just OK sometimes.</p>
<p>You may not be the fastest runner or highest jumper or heck, swim one pool length without snorting water up your nose... but hey, fun is fun.</p>

<section id="ember132" >
<h1 >Take ownership of your choices</h1>
<p>All choices have consequences—good and bad.</p>
<p>For example, you may love a certain food that doesn't love you back, so you eat that food only occasionally and have some Tums nearby.</p>
<p>You may love an activity that beats you up, so you do it once a week and sit on an ice pack when you get home.</p>
<p>Fully accept the consequences of all your choices.</p>
<p>Make choices mindfully and thoughtfully, with a good dose of self-awareness and loving honesty (sort of like when your BFF tells you that you have spinach stuck in your teeth).</p>
<p>You’re in control here. It’s your show.</p>

<section id="ember133" >
<h1 >Experiment and observe</h1>
<p>Many factors determine how YOUR unique body responds to food and exercise. Over time, experiment and observe what happens.</p>
<p>Here are some ideas.</p>
<p><strong >Your activity level</strong></p>
<p>The more active you are, the more nutrients (and often more carbohydrate) you'll need.</p>
<p>If you're an athlete with a high training load, or you teach fitness classes, you'll probably find you feel better with some slow-digesting carbs at every meal.</p>
<p>If your daily routine finds you sitting all day, you might do better keeping your carb intake lower and your fat intake relatively higher.</p>
<p><strong >Your stress level</strong></p>
<p>Stress changes many things, including our ability to tolerate and digest food.</p>
<p>You might find that when stressed, you have to choose foods that are more easily digested, or that food intolerances flare up. You might need to be more stringent about getting sleep or an extra dose of probiotics during these times.</p>
<p>Conversely, you might find that when you go on vacation, you can get away with eating things you wouldn't normally eat. An extra drink or piece of cheese that would give you a killer hangover or stomach upset during &quot;crunch time&quot; might not even faze you when you're chilling on the beach.</p>
<p><em >Quick Tip! You might also find that when you're more relaxed, it's a lot easier to lose fat effortlessly.</em></p>
<p><strong >Your health situation</strong></p>
<p>Many common chronic health problems change our response to food and activity.</p>
<p>For example, autoimmune diseases (such as rheumatoid arthritis, or thyroid disease) often come with food intolerances. Problems with hormones such as thyroid hormone, sex hormones (such as estrogens and androgens), or cortisol can affect insulin sensitivity and resistance.</p>
<p>If you're dealing with a chronic medical condition, notice what seems to make it better or worse.</p>

<section id="ember134" >
<h1 >What to focus on</h1>
<p><strong >Figure out what makes your unique body look, feel, and perform best.</strong></p>
<p>Do this by experimenting and observing.</p>
<p>Keep it simple. Start with the basic practices. Work on mastering those first.</p>
<p>Over time, experiment with adjusting your nutrition and/or activity based on what you might need, and see what happens.</p>
<p><strong >No matter what your skill level, stay focused on: making good food choices </strong><em ><b>consistently</b></em><strong>; eating slowly and mindfully, to 80% full, </strong><em ><b>consistently</b></em><strong>; and following practices consistently.</strong></p>
<p>Individualization is simply an addition to a strong existing foundation—not a substitute for it.</p>
