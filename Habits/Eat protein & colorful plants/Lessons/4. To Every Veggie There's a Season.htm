<p>Coach's Notes:&nbsp;Buying and eating fruits and veggies in season.</p> 
<form > 
<h1 >
<section id="ember112" >Why buy vegetables and fruits in season?</h1> 
<ul type=disc > 
<li >They're fresher.</li> 
<li >They taste better.</li> 
<li >They're more nutritious.</li> 
<li >They're more sustainable.</li> 
<li >For all of that, they’re sometimes also cheaper.</li> 
</ul> 
<p>When you buy seasonal produce from local, small-farm providers:</p> 
<ul type=disc > 
<li >You support your local community and economy.</li> 
<li >You directly support our societies' keystone workers (and often lowest-paid workers)—farmers.</li> 
<li >You get to know who grows your food, and maybe something about the work that goes into growing and sourcing that food.</li> 
<li >You cut down on fossil fuel use from food transport and refrigeration.</li> 
<li >You save money by cutting out waste and cost mark-ups from food processing.</li> 
</ul> 
<p>For the next few days, try to make as many of your meals as seasonally appropriate as possible. You could use this opportunity to try a new vegetable, fruit, or recipe for something in season. Enjoy the local variety.</p>
