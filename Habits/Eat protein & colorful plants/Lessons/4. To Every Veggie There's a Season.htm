<section id="ember112" >Why buy vegetables and fruits in season?</h1>
<ul type=disc >
<li >They're fresher.</li>
<li >They taste better.</li>
<li >They're more nutritious.</li>
<li >They're more sustainable.</li>
<li >For all of that, they’re sometimes also cheaper.</li>
</ul>
<p>When you buy seasonal produce from local, small-farm providers:</p>
<ul type=disc >
<li >You support your local community and economy.</li>
<li >You directly support our societies' keystone workers (and often lowest-paid workers)—farmers.</li>
<li >You get to know who grows your food, and maybe something about the work that goes into growing and sourcing that food.</li>
<li >You cut down on fossil fuel use from food transport and refrigeration.</li>
<li >You save money by cutting out waste and cost mark-ups from food processing.</li>
</ul>
<p>For the next few days, try to make as many of your meals as seasonally appropriate as possible. You could use this opportunity to try a new vegetable, fruit, or recipe for something in season. Enjoy the local variety.</p>
