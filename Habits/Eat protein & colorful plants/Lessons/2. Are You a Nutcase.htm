<p>Nuts: Beloved by squirrels. Chock-full of vitamins, minerals and healthy fats. A plant-based source of a little bit of protein. They're part of a healthy diet.</p>
<p>The catch to the sensationally beloved nut is that overeating is easy. That includes nuts and their tasty cousin, nut butter.</p>
<p>They taste amazing. They're convenient. They're versatile.</p>

<h1 >A-nut-omy</h1>
<p>While common knowledge often separates nuts and seeds as two different things, all nuts are actually seeds.</p>
<p>Peanuts are legumes, not true nuts. And, like all legumes (such as lentils), peanuts are also seeds.</p>

<p>Seeds are where plants store nutrients to enable the growth of a new plant. They're dense with energy, fat, protein and micronutrients, such as vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants.</p>
<p>Seeds have a fibrous protective layer and tough cell walls to protect the potential baby plant, so they're also high in fiber.</p>

<h1 >A little goes a long way</h1>
<p>Most nuts and seeds are high in fat, which makes them high in calories. Fats in nuts are healthy in moderate amounts.</p>
<p>Here's a list of a few common cautions for nuts.</p>
<li> Fats in nuts are healthy. Some is good. And, &quot;some&quot; can easily become &quot;too much&quot;, depending on your goals and how much you're eating.</li>
<li> <strong >Nuts contain only small amounts of protein. They aren't a primary protein source.</strong></li>
<li> Be careful of processed and flavored nuts, such as tamari almonds or beer nuts. These have had flavors, sugar, and salt added, which can quickly add empty calories and encourage overeating. Roasting nuts can destroy many of their chemically fragile healthy fats.</li>
<li> Complex tastes layered on interesting textures can make for a hyperpalatable combination that's practically irresistible. If the emotional fight against nut love is too difficult, it could be a struggle for moderation that's better left completely alone. Nuts, and especially nut butters, aren't an essential part of a healthy diet as long as healthy fats are coming from other sources (like meat, fish, eggs, avocados, or less irresistible seeds).</li>

<h1 >Getting nut portions right</h1>
<p>If you're eating nuts or nut butter, use your thumbs to gauge your portions. One serving is one thumb.</p>

<p> </p>
<p>1 thumb of nut butter or oil is about one tablespoon of oil or nut butter (one level scoop, rather than mounded-high scoop).</p>
