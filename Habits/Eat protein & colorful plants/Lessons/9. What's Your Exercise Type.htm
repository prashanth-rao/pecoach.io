<p><strong >As humans, movement is both a birthright and a privilege.</strong></p>
<p>Babies squirm and squiggle as soon as possible. Children love to move.</p>

<div class='figure'><img src='https://prashanth-rao.github.io/pecoach.io/Resource/img/33ad2750-7081-46f9-8ec5-f8d41a3ba642.jpg' width=100%></div>
<p> </p>
<p>For many, between our transition from the playground to the workplace, we forget how much we love to move. We decide that exercise is a chore, or it's something that &quot;other people&quot; are good at.</p>
<p><strong >If movement is a chore, making it enjoyable again may be a matter of practicing a mindset shift.</strong></p>
<p>Maybe, the problem isn't &quot;exercise&quot;, necessarily. The problem could be a mismatch between you—your natural type and style—and the activities you associate with &quot;exercise&quot;.</p>
</section>
<section id="ember130" >
<h1 >Your body type and exercise</h1>
<p>We tend to gravitate towards activities that best suit our physique and abilities.</p>
</section>
<section id="ember131" >
<p><strong >Ectomorphs</strong></p>
<p>Ectomorphs (the &quot;lighter-framed, leaner and lankier&quot; body types) tend to like endurance activities, or activities where they can use their height or leanness to advantage.</p>
</section>
<section id="ember132" >
<div class='figure'><img src='https://prashanth-rao.github.io/pecoach.io/Resource/img/5f386372-8c2d-43a3-becc-a9831499e11f.jpg' width=100%></div>

</ul>
</section>
<section id="ember134" >
<p><strong >Mesomorphs</strong></p>
<p>Mesomorphs (the &quot;muscular mediums&quot;) tend to like quick, explosive activities, where they can use their athleticism, speed, and strength.</p>
</section>
<section id="ember135" >
<div class='figure'><img src='https://prashanth-rao.github.io/pecoach.io/Resource/img/9e485957-ca56-47bb-b1b3-2ea4ef34a2f1.jpg' width=100%></div>

</ul>
</section>
<section id="ember137" >
<p><strong >Endomorphs</strong></p>
<p>Endomorphs are larger-framed people and put on fat more easily. They tend to like slower-paced or strength activities where size is an advantage.</p>
</section>
<section id="ember138" >
<div class='figure'><img src='https://prashanth-rao.github.io/pecoach.io/Resource/img/18812e00-c492-48b3-bc4b-db06e56eabd7.jpg' width=100%></div>

<li >baseball and softball</li>

<li >strength sports (e.g., powerlifting, strongwoman, Olympic lifting, Highland Games)</li>
<li >heavier weight classes in martial arts, wrestling, or boxing</li>
<li >football and rugby</li>
<li >throwing sports (e.g., discus, shotput)</li>
<li >hiking</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="ember140" >
<h1 >Your &quot;exercise personality&quot;</h1>
<p>We all have &quot;exercise personalities&quot; as well as a body type.</p>
<ul type=disc >
<li >Do you prefer exercising with a large group, one workout partner, or alone?</li>
<li >Do you prefer indoor or outdoor exercise?</li>
<li >Do you prefer spontaneous, loosely organized activity (such as a game of pickup basketball) or well-planned, clearly structured activity (such as a class or course)?</li>
<li >Do you like to compete against other people as part of a team (e.g., hockey)? Against one other person (e.g, boxing)? Against yourself (e.g., climbing)? Or not at all (e.g., yoga)?</li>
<li >Do you like exercise to rev you up or calm you down?</li>
<li >What do you like to feel when you exercise? Strong? Fast? Energized? Joyful?</li>
<li >Do you like exercise to be intellectually challenging (e.g., learning a new skill or doing an obstacle course) or intellectually relaxing (e.g., running on a treadmill, where you can zone out)?</li>
<li >Do you prefer someone else to push or direct you, or do you prefer to be self-directed?</li>
<li >Do you like exercise to be useful (e.g., learning outdoor survival skills) or playful (e.g., Frisbee)?</li>
<li >What kind of music do you like to listen to when you exercise? And do you like exercising to music at all?</li>
<li >What movements or activities make you feel good? What are your strengths, and what movements or activities match those?</li>
</ul>
<p>Just like body types, most folks are a mix of &quot;exercise personalities&quot;.</p>
</section>
<section id="ember141" >
<h1 >Find your niche</h1>
<p><strong >Find what fits you.</strong></p>
<p>1. <strong >Think about your body type and &quot;exercise personality&quot;.</strong></p>
<p>What type of activities appeal to you? Which ones do you naturally gravitate towards?</p>
<p>2. <strong >Consider what activities might suit you, or which ones you might like to try.</strong></p>
<p>Then… why not try them?</p>
<p>3. <strong >Mix it up. Try new activities.</strong></p>
<p>If you're an endomorph who's frustrated by marathons, maybe you'll discover you're actually the next Serena Williams.</p>
<p>4. <strong >Try and do as many activities as possible.</strong></p>
<p>If you're enjoying an exercise that may not be ideal for your body type, that's perfectly fine. Having a broad repertoire of movement choices is part of being a fit person.</p>
</section>
<section id="ember142" >
<h1 >Be brave</h1>
<p>You may also find that as you get into better shape, you want to try more new activities—and you’re more able to do those new activities.</p>
<p><strong >Get creative. Be brave. Try all kinds of things as you progress.</strong></p>
<p>You might feel a little silly, self-conscious or unsure of yourself when you start a new activity.</p>
<p>That’s normal. And when you try something you've never done before, you won't be awesome at it. That's OK.</p>
<p>Stick to it, keep practicing, focus on getting a little sweaty and having fun, and you might be amazed at what can happen.</p>
