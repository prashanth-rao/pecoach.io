<section id="ember123" >Self-experiment: Eat like our ancestors</h1>
<p>An ancestral diet (also known as a Paleo or Primal-style eating) involves eating <strong >only whole foods that early humans could have hunted, dug up, and/or gathered</strong>.</p>

<h1 >Testing hypotheses</h1>
<p>Here are two research questions:</p>
<p>1. What is this experience like for me?</p>
<p>2. What does this experience teach me about myself and what works for me?</p>
<p>Depending on your goals, there are different criteria you can evaluate to determine whether something works for you.</p>
<p>A few examples are:</p>
<ul type=disc >
<li >Do you feel good inside and out?</li>
<li >Are you performing well in the gym?</li>
<li >Are you meeting your goals?</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="ember126" >
<h1 >What to eat on an ancestral diet</h1>
<p><strong >Any animal, including:</strong></p>
<ul type=disc >
<li >any and all land and sea animals: (chicken, turkey, duck, beef, pork, fish, seafood, wild game, etc.)</li>
<li >any eggs (chicken, duck, fish, etc.)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong >Almost all plants, including:</strong></p>
<ul type=disc >
<li >any vegetable (whether those are leaves, stems, starchy roots, etc.)</li>
<li >any fruit</li>
<li >any seeds or plant sugar that is edible when raw (such as nuts, coconuts, honey, maple syrup)</li>
</ul>
<p>Limit your sweets like honey and fresh/dried fruit. Prehistoric fruit was rarely very sweet, and in most places, only available in season.</p>
<p><strong >Eat less of:</strong></p>
<ul type=disc >
<li >grains or grain products (such as bread or pasta)</li>
<li >processed dairy such as cheese, ice cream, or yogurt</li>
<li >beans or legumes</li>
<li >sugar or artificial sweeteners</li>
<li >any other processed foods such as soy milk, protein powder, diet sodas</li>
</ul>

<h1 >Make this experiment work for <em >you</em></h1>
<p>Ancestral diets are diverse. The fundamental thing they have in common is that they're made of foods that early humans could have acquired.</p>
<p>What that looks like for you specifically, is up to you.</p>
</section>
<section id="ember128" >
<h1 >Plant-based eater?</h1>
<p>That can work. Most prehistoric people wouldn't manage to eat animals every single day either.</p>
<p>However, there's a challenge: You have to figure out how to get some protein without grains, beans, legumes, processed dairy, or protein powders.</p>
<p>It won't be perfect. That's fine.</p>
<p><strong >This is about experimentation, not perfection.</strong></p>
</section>
<section id="ember129" >
<h1 >Do I have to eat it all raw?</h1>
<p>Nah. Early humans had fire—and tough stomachs. It's OK to cook. (Unless you want to go out for sashimi or beef tartare. Your call.)</p>
</section>
<section id="ember130" >
<h1 >What counts as a whole food?</h1>
<p>You have some leeway here.</p>
<ul type=disc >
<li >You can include nut butter or cold-pressed extra-virgin oils.</li>
<li >You can eat the meat you like… no need to feel obligated to eat seal liver or whale blubber.</li>
<li >You can eat <em >minimally</em> processed whole foods, such as frozen vegetables.</li>
</ul>

<p> </p>
<p>Give your regular supplements such as EAAs and protein powders a break, just during the experiment.</p>
</section>
<section id="ember133" >
<h1 >What should I make?</h1>
<p>You may already be well accustomed to eating ancestral-style. Some common ancestral meals could look like...</p>
<p>Meal 1 – Eggs scrambled with vegetables and a bit of coconut oil</p>
<p>Meal 2 – Chicken coconut curry with vegetables</p>
<p>Meal 3 – Turkey meatballs + salsa with avocado</p>
<p>Meal 4 – Steak, salad with olive oil vinaigrette, and berries for dessert</p>
<p>Dang! That sounds really good!</p>
