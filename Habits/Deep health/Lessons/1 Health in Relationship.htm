<p><strong >To stay lean and healthy, you need to give back.</strong></p> 
<p>Science supports it. Scientists studying the genetics and molecular biology of cancer and other chronic diseases recently made a couple of interesting discoveries:</p> 
<ul type=disc > 
<li >Loneliness and feeling alienated from other people tells our cells to produce inflammation and suppress our immune system.</li> 
<li >Social connections do the opposite. Strong relationships and helping other people physically strengthen our bodies.</li> 
</ul> 
<p>In other words, when someone feels bad and/or isolated, their cells and body chemistry show it. When they connect with and help others, their cells and body chemistry show that too.</p> 
<p>Interestingly, it's not only thinking about relationships that keep cells healthy. It's acts of helping others and feeling connected in a meaningful way that creates the positive changes in body chemistry.</p> 
<p><strong >No one gets healthy in isolation. Lasting fitness and deep health are a shared project.</strong></p> 
<p>Think about a time in your past that you felt deeply that you wanted to make a lot of change. Were you nervous, frustrated or confused? Grumpy, intimidated or lost? Struggling to move your body, or sick and tired of being sick and tired?</p> 
<p>How did that change happen alongside of other people? Who else was involved? A coach, friends and family, gym staff, or a thoughtful barista?</p>

<h1 >You can give back</h1> 
<p>Everyone is on a journey of figuring things out for themselves, in different ways. Everyone is working on mastering their own basic principles. We have a lot to learn from each other, and a lot to share.</p> 
<p><strong >You're an expert of your experience. You have unique experience, insight, and empathy to share.</strong></p> 
<p>You've done a lot, tried a lot, and learned a lot. You know how it feels to stumble through new practices and a new routine. It's very possible that some of that experience, insight, and empathy could help someone else.</p>

<h1 >It's all connected</h1> 
<p><strong >Meaningful human relationships are crucial for health.</strong></p> 
<p>Everything psychological is ultimately biological. When we're feeling good, deeply, it's a sign that the whole body is functioning well. When bodies are functioning, they're more likely to stay lean, strong, and healthy for a whole amazing lifetime.</p> 
<p>Even more, when people feel valued by others, they're more likely to value themselves. When people value themselves—their lives and their bodies—they're more likely to make positive, healthy choices.</p> 
<p>When we support deep health in all dimensions, it's easier to eat well. A healthy fit body depends on healthy, fit relationships with the world around us.</p> 
<p>You get what you give. When we do positive things in the world, it benefits our bodies, our lives… and everyone around us.</p>
