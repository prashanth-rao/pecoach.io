<section id="ember113" >Buddy up with some health hench people.</h1>
<p>There are two ways to improve and expand your fitness support network:</p>
<p>1. find a new fit friend; and/or</p>
<p>2. have some fitness fun with an old friend.</p>
</section>
<section id="ember114" >
<h1 >Find a new friend</h1>
<p>Try saying <em >hi</em> to someone you meet as part of your regular fitness routine.</p>
<p>Start up a conversation with someone at your gym, or anywhere else you see healthy people frequently. Make eye contact, smile, and be pleasant.</p>
<p>Try a new activity and/or join a meetup group. For instance:</p>
<ul type=disc >
<li >Take a new class, and be friendly when you do it.</li>
<li >Check out <a href="http://www.meetup.com/" target="_blank" >meetup.com</a> to see gatherings in your area.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="ember115" >
<h1 >Enjoy old friends</h1>
<p>Think of who you already know. Partner? Girl/boy friend? Kids? Family members? Friends? Coworkers?</p>
<p>Now, think about how you can spend time with them in a way that is physically active.</p>
<ul type=disc >
<li >Play with your kids at the park.</li>
<li >Go on an &quot;activity date&quot; with your partner or girl/boyfriend—go cycling, dancing, hiking, etc. together.</li>
<li >Walk the dog together as a family.</li>
<li >Meet a friend for a workout or a physical activity outing (such as a fun class) instead of dinner/drinks.</li>
<li >Have &quot;walking meetings&quot; with your coworkers—solve your company problems outside during a brisk stroll.</li>
<li >Set up intramural sports at work.</li>
</ul>

<p>If your family and friends aren't super-sporty, don't despair. Even a gentle stroll around the mall or ramble to the local coffee shop counts.</p>
