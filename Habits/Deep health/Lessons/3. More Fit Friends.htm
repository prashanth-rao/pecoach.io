<section id="ember113" >Buddy up with some health hench people.</h1> 
<p>There are two ways to improve and expand your fitness support network:</p> 
<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp; find a new fit friend; and/or</p> 
<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp; have some fitness fun with an old friend.</p> 
</section>
<section id="ember114" > 
<h1 >Find a new friend</h1> 
<p>Try saying&nbsp;<em >hi</em>&nbsp;to someone you meet as part of your regular fitness routine.</p> 
<p>Start up a conversation with someone at your gym, or anywhere else you see healthy people frequently. Make eye contact, smile, and be pleasant.</p> 
<p>Try a new activity and/or join a meetup group. For instance:</p> 
<ul type=disc > 
<li >Take a new class, and be friendly when you do it.</li> 
<li >Check out&nbsp;<a href="http://www.meetup.com/" target="_blank" >meetup.com</a>&nbsp;to see gatherings in your area.</li> 
</ul> 
</section>
<section id="ember115" > 
<h1 >Enjoy old friends</h1> 
<p>Think of who you already know. Partner? Girl/boy friend? Kids? Family members? Friends? Coworkers?</p> 
<p>Now, think about how you can spend time with them in a way that is physically active.</p> 
<ul type=disc > 
<li >Play with your kids at the park.</li> 
<li >Go on an &quot;activity date&quot; with your partner or girl/boyfriend—go cycling, dancing, hiking, etc. together.</li> 
<li >Walk the dog together as a family.</li> 
<li >Meet a friend for a workout or a physical activity outing (such as a fun class) instead of dinner/drinks.</li> 
<li >Have &quot;walking meetings&quot; with your coworkers—solve your company problems outside during a brisk stroll.</li> 
<li >Set up intramural sports at work.</li> 
</ul>
