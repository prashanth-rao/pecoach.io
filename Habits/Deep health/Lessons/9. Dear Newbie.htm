<p>Coach's Notes:&nbsp;What would a client say to a newbie? What advice would they give to help someone just starting out?</p> 
<form > 
<h1 >
<section id="ember112" >You've made some changes.</h1> 
<p>Think about your experience in making deliberate changes in your life. What insights have you gained? About yourself, nutrition, exercise, or living the good life?</p> 
<p>And think about how this experience and insight gives you empathy—the ability to connect based on shared feelings. To recognize and—to some degree—&quot;get&quot; other people's struggles and victories.</p> 
</section>
<section id="ember113" > 
<h1 >Where did you come from?</h1> 
<p>Do you remember how you used to be? What's different now than then? What are the changes that have most defined &quot;before&quot; and &quot;after&quot;? Try to remember the full picture of &quot;before&quot;...</p> 
<ul type=disc > 
<li >What were you doing?</li> 
<li >What were you thinking?</li> 
<li >What did you feel?</li> 
<li >How did your body look? Perform? Feel?</li> 
</ul> 
<p>Once you have a clear, rich image, put someone else in your place.</p> 
<p>Imagine yourself as another person. A newbie, just like you, starting this coaching program.</p> 
</section>
<section id="ember114" > 
<h1 >What would you say?</h1> 
<p>Imagine sitting down with that newbie. You're the older, wiser athlete. You understand how they feel and think.</p> 
<ul type=disc > 
<li >What advice do you give them?</li> 
<li >What would you say to help them?</li> 
<li >What would you share of your own experience?</li> 
</ul> 
<p>Write down in the space below how you could help them on the start of their own coaching journey.</p>
