<section id="ember116" >Oh, the adventures you'll have ...</h1> 
<p>Imagine that you have seamlessly, fully integrated healthy eating and living into your life.</p> 
<p>You're easily hitting basic healthy eating practices, every day without even thinking about it, loving your vegetables, walking the dog every day, and sleeping like a tranquilized log.</p> 
<p><strong >What would you do with the rest of the time?</strong></p> 
<p>If you weren't being such an avid fitness hobbyist, what else would you do that was meaningful? Fun? Interesting? Relevant?</p> 
<p><strong >What's keeping you from doing those things?</strong></p>
