<p>Imagine that you have seamlessly, fully integrated healthy eating and living into your life.</p>
<p>You're easily hitting basic healthy eating practices, every day without even thinking about it, loving your vegetables, walking the dog every day, and sleeping like a tranquilized log.</p>
<p><strong >What would you do with the rest of the time?</strong></p>
<p>If you weren't being such an avid fitness hobbyist, what else would you do that was meaningful? Fun? Interesting? Relevant?</p>
<p><strong >What's keeping you from doing those things?</strong></p>
</section>
<section id="ember117" >
<h1 >Change course</h1>
<p>While it's perfectly fine to want a lean and healthy body for life, you can't lose fat forever. At some point, you have to change focus.</p>

<p>Today, <strong >re-assess what will be meaningful, significant, and valuable to you in the next several months</strong>. After your fitness achievements are reached, then what's meaningful?</p>
<ul type=disc >
<li >A new activity? Or a recently neglected hobby?</li>
<li >Traveling to a foreign place?</li>
<li >Doing something with a loved one?</li>
<li >Spending more relaxed time with friends?</li>
<li >Engaging in the arts and culture?</li>
</ul>
<p>After the hard work of getting to a new fit and healthy place is done, there will be a lot more time for enjoying and savoring.</p>

<section id="ember120" >
<h1 >Think about what's next for you</h1>
<p><strong >Focus on what you might work towards doing in the next 3 to 6 months. Can you start to incorporate that vision as a goal?</strong></p>
<ul type=disc >
<li >What excites you?</li>
<li >What's fun? What makes you go &quot;wheee!&quot;?</li>
<li >What scares or challenges you physically?</li>
<li >What makes you feel engaged in life and the world/people around you?</li>
<li >What makes you feel connected to and proud of your own body?</li>
<li >What do you think is valuable and important in life?</li>
<li >What makes you feel comfortable and confident in your own skin?</li>
<li >What makes you feel strong, fast, powerful, skilled, capable—or just able to handle life?</li>
</ul>
<p><strong >There's no endpoint to a fitness journey.</strong></p>
