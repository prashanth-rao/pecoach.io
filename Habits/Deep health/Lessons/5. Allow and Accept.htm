<section id="ember117" >From &quot;attachment and avoidance&quot; to &quot;allow and accept&quot;</h1>
<p><strong >Live in the present, with the body you have. It's the only one you have. It's come a long way, and there's a lot to be proud of.</strong></p>
<p><i>All anguish comes from attachment.<br > —Buddhist saying</i></p>
<p><i>The only way out is through.<br > —Carl Jung</i></p>
<p>Both desire and pain in life comes largely from two things:</p>
<ul type=disc >
<li >attachment (to things and ideas) and</li>
<li >avoidance (of stuff we don't like or want).</li>
</ul>
<p>For instance, if you're attached too strongly to ideas like &quot;I must be perfect&quot;, &quot;If I'm not lean then I'm unworthy&quot;, or &quot;I should have/be ____&quot;, then changing your body may not be the source of the pain. It may be that you'll feel crappy even after you're fitter and healthier.</p>
<p>Furthermore, trying to avoid the discomfort of those thoughts or feelings may compound the problem.</p>
</section>
<section id="ember118" >
<h1 >There's another way</h1>
<p>The opposite of attachment and avoidance: <strong >allow and accept</strong>.</p>
<p><strong >Allow thoughts and sensations to be present.</strong></p>
<p>Observe whatever comes up. View these thoughts, feelings, and experiences as simply the ebb and flow of existence.</p>
<p>Allow them to move through you, without avoiding them. Without attachment or avoidance, the thoughts can simply flow right through you.</p>

<p> </p>
<p><strong >Accept the reality of living, that all kinds of thoughts, feelings, and experiences will constantly come and go.</strong></p>
<p>You don't have to love them. Sit with those thoughts, feelings, and experiences. Rather than avoiding, hang out with it.</p>
<p>Imagine hanging out with your roommate's awkward friend, watching TV on the couch while your roommate gets ready.</p>
<p>The awkward friend is the unwanted thought, feeling or experience. For now, you're stuck with them. So you might as well hang out with them, even if it's uncomfortable.</p>
<p>At the core of this practice is understanding that you have power to change your perceptions.</p>
<p><strong >You are something more than a particular thought, feeling, belief.</strong></p>

<h1 >Emotions: Your dashboard indicator light</h1>
<p>Feelings often seem &quot;irrational&quot;. It's easy to feel embarrassed or puzzled by them. When something feels unfamiliar, it's easy to want to make it go away.</p>
<p>However, the human brain produces emotions and physical sensations for a reason: to tell us something important.</p>
<p>Emotions and physical sensations are essential signals that tell us about our environment and what's going on inside us—they're like our dashboard indicator lights.</p>

<p> </p>
<p>If we're willing to simply experience our emotions and physical sensations (especially uncomfortable ones), then we might find that it's much easier to tolerate feeling badly.</p>
<p>And if we ask those emotions and physical sensations, &quot;What are you trying to tell me?&quot;, then we might gain some critical insights.</p>
<p><strong >You can't control your feelings. You can control your behavior in response to those feelings, and work on grooving new practices in thought and action.</strong></p>
