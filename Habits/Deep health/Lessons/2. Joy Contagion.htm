<h2 align=center >The more you divide joy, the more it multiplies.</h2>

<section id="ember113" >The more you divide joy, the more it multiplies.</h1> 
<p>There is an inexhaustible energy source in the world. No, it's not cold fusion. That energy source is joy.</p> 
<p>The more you divide it and spread it around, the more it multiplies.</p> 
</section>
<section id="ember114" > 
<h1 >What do you love?</h1> 
<p>In life of fitness and nutrition, what's fun to you?</p> 
<ul type=disc > 
<li >What is cool?</li> 
<li >Interesting?</li> 
<li >Awesome?</li> 
<li >Joyful?</li> 
</ul> 
<p>Whatever it is, share it. Find a person who's a worthy recipient of your gift of joy. For example, your partner, your kid, a friend, a coworker, etc. Anyone who will respond positively is fair game.</p> 
<p><strong >Communicate your joy—very practically—to that person.</strong></p> 
</section>
<section id="ember115" > 
<h1 >Some examples</h1> 
<ul type=disc > 
<li >If there's a sport or activity you love, invite someone to participate or at least join you at a game. Explain the rules to him or her, and share why you think this is so cool.</li> 
<li >If there's a healthy recipe you think is delicious, make it for someone else. Or, make it together. And then give them the recipe.</li> 
<li >If you think there's a workout exercise that's the best exercise ever invented and it makes you feel like a superhero when you do it, help someone else learn to do it.</li> 
<li >If you've just managed to do your first pull-up (or your first weighted pull-up), bust out the bands and help someone else get started. (Once you stop squealing with glee, that is.)</li> 
<li >If you have the most awesome workout song in the world, share it. Then rock out together.</li> 
</ul> 
</section>
<section id="ember116" > 
<h1 >What if they don’t love my stuff?</h1> 
<p>Not everyone will love your stuff as much as you do. But there's something about true joy that is catching.</p> 
<p>Remember that great prof or teacher you had? The one that made boring stuff interesting—whether it was her funny cartoons about statistics, or his reading of Chaucer doing all the voices, or her fully-costumed re-enactment of the great battles of history? That could be you.</p> 
<p>Joy is contagious. It spreads like a virus. At the very least, people will be inspired by your energy.</p> 
<p>Then they can go find their own joy, and you'll have shared something special.</p>
