<p>Coach's Notes:&nbsp;Have a &quot;meal of meaning&quot; with others.</p>

<section id="ember117" >Put meaning on the menu and start a food conversation.</h1> 
<p>A Meal of Meaning is a family or friend dinner under the following conditions:</p> 
<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp; Each person chooses whatever they want to eat—&quot;healthy&quot; or otherwise—with the main rule …</p> 
<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong >Their choice of dish must be meaningful to them in a personal way.</strong></p> 
<p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp; Each person explains their food choices, why it's meaningful to them, and where it came from.</p> 
<p>4.&nbsp;&nbsp; Discuss and enjoy. Eat slowly, take time to converse, and explore other people's choice of foods.</p> 
<p>5.&nbsp;&nbsp; Finish together. Even if you finish eating before others, stay present and engaged in the conversation.</p> 
<p>The more diverse the crowd, the more diverse the stories and the food might be. Diversity can come in many forms. Even if the food choices are familiar, you may learn an unknown detail about the people closest to you.</p>

<h1 >Shopping and preparation</h1> 
<p><strong >Involve everyone in shopping and preparation</strong>, even if that's just helping to make a shopping list. If you shop with others, have a discussion about what you're buying.</p> 
<p><strong >If possible, involve everyone in cooking</strong>—again, if that's just a small task like husking corn or stirring a soup.</p> 
<p>For this meal, there are no &quot;rules&quot;.&nbsp;<strong >The only &quot;rule&quot; is that your choices be meaningful, and you communicate that to others in some way.</strong></p>

<h1 >Eating and communicating</h1> 
<p>During the meal,&nbsp;<strong >eat slowly</strong>.</p> 
<p><strong >Practice your listening skills.</strong>&nbsp;Really try to understand where people are coming from as they explain their food choices.</p> 
<p><strong >Ask people about their food stories.</strong>&nbsp;If a food is significant to them, it usually has a story behind it. Discover that narrative.</p> 
<p><strong >Listen without judgment.</strong>&nbsp;Give people time and space to share their own food stories.</p> 
<p><strong >Ask questions</strong>, instead of telling people why Food X is &quot;bad&quot; or &quot;good&quot;. Treat this as an anthropology experiment: Observe carefully and seek to understand.</p> 
<p><strong >Try to learn more about your friends and family.</strong></p>

<h1 >What if I don't like the food?</h1> 
<p>Ideally, this is your chance to share your joy, and others to do the same.</p> 
<p>If someone brings something &quot;unhealthy&quot;, that's fine. The rules don't say you have to eat it. The rules ask that you try to understand why that food is important to that person. What associations does that food have for them? What stories are connected to it?</p>
