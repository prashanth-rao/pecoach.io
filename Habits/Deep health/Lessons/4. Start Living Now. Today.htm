<p><strong >If you've had a long history of dieting and gaining/losing weight, you've probably had many moments of feeling awkward and unattractive.</strong></p>
<p>Maybe you hid under clothes, or skipped the trip to the beach. Maybe you missed out on lots of activities because you were too focused on feeling bad. Maybe you isolated yourself in order to eat.</p>
<p>Or maybe you just promised yourself that &quot;some day&quot; you would do… whatever it was you never did.</p>
</section>
<section id="ember112" >
<h1 >What lasts? What gets remembered?</h1>
<p>Whatever you want to do, whatever you dream of, whatever you've been avoiding because of being &quot;too fat&quot; or &quot;too out of shape&quot;, start doing it.</p>
<p>And in particular, do those things that connect you to other people and important relationships.</p>
<ul type=disc >
<li ><strong >Your kids won't remember how you looked in a bathing suit.</strong> They'll remember that you took them to the beach. And that you felt nice and soft when you hugged them.</li>
<li ><strong >Your family won't remember how your belly stuck out after a holiday meal.</strong> They'll remember that you were there, sharing the good times.</li>
<li ><strong >Your partner won't remember whether you ate the &quot;right&quot; kind of carbs.</strong> They'll remember sharing an anniversary dinner.</li>
<li ><strong >Your workout buddy won't remember the day you split your pants while squatting.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Well, maybe they might. But you'll laugh about it together.</p>
<p>And even if by some ridiculous chance someone you love does notice and remember those things, do you think they'll really care?</p>
</section>
<section id="ember113" >
<h1 >Be your own hero</h1>
<p>What have you avoided doing because of worries about weight, body image, dietary regime, or fitness level? What has that avoidance cost you?</p>
<p>What do you dream of doing? How can you do that thing?</p>
<p>If you really want to do something, or it's truly meaningful to a loved one, then do it.</p>
<p>Be the hero of your own movie, and start living now. Today.</p>
