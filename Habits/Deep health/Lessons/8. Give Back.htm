<p>Do you love healthy eating, exercise, and living well?</p>
<p>Hell yeah you do!!</p>
<p>It doesn't matter whether you've reached your goals or are still walking the path (occasionally straying, and always coming back).</p>
<p><strong >Your whole healthy </strong><em ><b>life</b></em><strong> is a testament to the power of solid nutrition and regular activity.</strong></p>
<p>People around you have seen the changes. You feel the changes inside. You can't un-ring that bell. You've felt that power.</p>
<p><strong >You're a deep health ambassador. And, whether you realize it or not, you can inspire others. You can do tremendous good in the world.</strong></p>

<p> </p>
<h1 >Inspire</h1>
<p><strong >Take a moment, and think about the people who have inspired you.</strong></p>
<p>Imagine them clearly, and how they affected your life.</p>
<p>Who were they? What feelings did they provoke in you? Why?</p>
<p>Quite likely, those folks who inspired you aren't superhuman. They're probably just &quot;average folks&quot;, like you.</p>
<p>In fact, it's <em >because</em> these people are &quot;average folks&quot; that they're so inspiring. You can identify with them. They're real. You can see their struggles.</p>
<p><strong >You may have figured out, we can't change people's behavior by </strong><em ><b>telling</b></em><strong> them what to do. People change through </strong><em ><b>inspiration</b></em><strong>.</strong></p>
<p>You change people by <em >helping</em> them find their own way. By being a positive example and building meaningful relationships—whether that's by being a teacher, a coach, or a friend.</p>
<p>You don't have to be the fitness equivalent of Gandhi or Martin Luther King. Just be yourself, and do what you love. Spread the goodness in any small way you can.</p>
<p><strong >Today, think about inspiring healthy living in others.</strong></p>
<p>How do you give back to the world, in a small way?</p>
</section>
<section id="ember116" >
<h1 >Practice giving back</h1>
<p>Think of the last time you did something nice for someone, just for the pleasure of doing it. Remember how great that felt?</p>
<p>Well guess what: You can get that warm and fuzzy feeling <em >any time you like…</em> simply by getting out and doing good. Yes, it's just that easy!</p>
<p><strong >Think about some way to volunteer to promote and &quot;live&quot; healthy eating and exercise out in your community</strong>.</p>
<ul type=disc >
<li >Volunteer at a food bank or shelter to serve food</li>
<li >Volunteer at a farm or community garden with harvest or other prep (it <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23597347" target="_blank" >might even help you stay lean</a>!)</li>
<li >Volunteer to teach kids about healthy eating/exercise (e.g. at Scouts, a local school, etc.)</li>
<li >Start a healthy recipe swap group or meetup—heck, why not start a healthy eating dinner party club? Once a month, get some friends together and issue a healthy meal potluck challenge, with prizes for the most creative/delicious use of kale!</li>
<li >Start an exercise group or participate in a session of some kind (e.g. walking psychotherapy, at-risk youth fitness, etc. etc.)</li>
<li >Do a charity fitness event (such as the <a href="http://terryfox.org/Run/" target="_blank" >Terry Fox Run</a>) for a cause that you believe in</li>
<li >Walk dogs for the Humane Society or a local animal shelter</li>
<li >Volunteer to coach a kids' sports team</li>
