<section id="ember111" >Imagine Your &quot;Perfect Day&quot;</h1>
<p><strong >Imagine that one night, as you sleep, your world magically changes into everything you want it to be.</strong></p>
<p>Every desire, every dream, everything you wish for has happened.</p>
<p>Your life is now utter perfection.</p>
<p>You're asleep, of course, so you don't know this has occurred.</p>
<p>In the morning, you open your eyes. You look around.</p>
<p><strong >How do you know that things have changed? What tells you that your life is now different?</strong></p>
</section>
<section id="ember112" >
<h1 >How are you getting closer?</h1>
<p>Reflect back on a specific and memorable process of change that you've experienced at any time in your life. For example, that change could have started one month ago, one year ago, or many years ago.</p>
<p>Thinking back to that point in the past, how would you answer these questions?</p>
<ul type=disc >
<li >Who are you?</li>
<li >What do you value?</li>
<li >What are your goals?</li>
<li >What will tell you that you;re getting better at living and doing these things?</li>
<li >If you get what you want, how will you know?</li>
</ul>
<p>How do the answers to those questions compare to where you see yourself now?</p>
<p><em >&quot;Right now, at the end of this coaching journey … how do I imagine my 'perfect day'?&quot;</em></p>
<p>Envision that day clearly. What's happening? Who's there? What are you doing?</p>
<p>Take a moment to visualize a very specific picture. Jot down some notes if you like.</p>
<p>Then, the challenge:</p>
</section>
<section id="ember113" >
<h1 >Live Your Perfect Day today</h1>
<p><strong >…live today as </strong><em ><b>if this perfect day has already happened</b></em><strong>.</strong></p>
<ul type=disc >
<li >If you imagine being happy, <strong >be happy</strong>.</li>
<li >If you imagine having an adventure, <strong >have an adventure</strong>.</li>
<li >If you imagine being strong enough to do or say something, <strong >do or say it</strong>.</li>
<li >If you imagine feeling sexy and attractive, <strong >feel sexy and attractive</strong>. (You stone cold fox, you.)</li>
</ul>
<p>As much as possible today, live &quot;as if&quot;. As if your &quot;perfect day&quot; is here.</p>
