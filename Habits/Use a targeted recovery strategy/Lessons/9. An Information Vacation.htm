<section id="ember107" >Less information = better body.</h1>
<p>We live in an information-rich society. It's never been so quick and easy to get and consume information.</p>
<p>Thanks to the fitness media, we know about every diet and workout plan on earth.</p>
<p>But are we happier? More relaxed? More focused? More confident about our decisions?</p>
<p>Are our bodies and minds better for it?</p>
<p>Arguably, no. On all counts.</p>
<p><strong >It's not simply </strong><em ><b>more information</b></em><strong> that makes us better</strong>, or more options.</p>
<p>These things <em >do</em> create more brain chatter and less focus.</p>
<p><strong >It's more deliberate, </strong><em ><b>conscious choices and actions</b></em><strong>, consistently, that makes us better.</strong></p>

<section id="ember108" >
<h1 >Take an information vacation</h1>
<p>Practice tuning-out of media, in any ways that you can. Experiment with taking in less.</p>
<p>What do you discover on your information vacation?</p>
<ul type=disc >
<li >What's challenging?</li>
<li >What's easy?</li>
<li >What changes?</li>
<li >What do you learn about yourself?</li>
</ul>

<section id="ember109" >
<h1 >What's good?</h1>
<p><strong >Where possible, focus on the benefits of this information vacation.</strong></p>
<p>Such as potentially:</p>
<ul type=disc >
<li >having more time (imagine what you could do with those extra minutes or hours)</li>
<li >taking more action</li>
<li >feeling more calm and focused</li>
<li >doing less &quot;compare and despair&quot; with others' lifestyles or bodies</li>
</ul>
<p>What happens when you try to shift focus from <em >&quot;knowing&quot;</em> and <em >&quot;thinking&quot;</em> to <em >&quot;feeling&quot;</em> and <em >&quot;doing&quot;</em>?</p>
