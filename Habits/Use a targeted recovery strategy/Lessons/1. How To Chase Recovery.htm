<p><strong >The importance of recovery</strong></p>
<p>You don't get fitter, stronger and healthier during a workout.</p>
<p><strong >You get fitter, stronger and healthier because your body can rebuild </strong><em ><b>between</b></em><strong> workouts.</strong></p>
<p>Recovery is about helping your body do its job. For most of us with busy and often-stressful lives, recovery won't happen by accident. It has to be actively <em >chosen</em>.</p>
<p><strong >We have to </strong><em ><b>chase</b></em><strong> it.</strong></p>
<p>We have to decide that rebuilding and replenishing is a priority, and take actions to make it happen.</p>

<h1 >Choosing purposeful recovery</h1>
<p>Think about all the things that could help your whole body and mind recover from the demands of your life and your activities. If you like, imagine a time when you felt most fully recovered, re-invigorated, and replenished. What were you doing?</p>
<p>Practicing active recovery could mean:</p>
<ul type=disc >
<li >making sure you get lean protein at every meal, consistently</li>
<li >making sure you get enough colorful fruits and veggies everyday, consistently</li>
<li >working on your sleep ritual, consistently (maybe grabbing quick naps)</li>
<li >planning and preparing meals that are as nourishing as possible</li>
<li >doing &quot;non-exercise&quot;, fun movement as often as possible, such as a brisk walk outside in the sunshine, a relaxed bike ride, or tossing the Frisbee around with your kid or dog (Remember playing? That's still a thing people are allowed to do)</li>
<li >doing an extra 5 minutes of mobility work before working out, to really get the ol' bod nice and flexy</li>
<li >taking a warm bath with Epsom salts (a good pre-bed ritual option)</li>
<li >getting a massage, even if it's just 5 minutes of foam rolling</li>
<li >taking some quiet time out in nature, even if it's just sitting on a park bench watching the clouds for a few minutes</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="ember109" >
<h1 >As always, work with your body</h1>
<p>Figuring out the right recovery strategies for <em >you</em> means experimenting with new strategies, and paying attention to what's working for you.</p>
<p>If you try a new strategy, how will you know if it's working? Maybe...</p>
<ul type=disc >
<li >Fatigue and muscle soreness after workouts is less dramatic</li>
<li >You wake up in the morning feeling more refreshed and energized</li>
<li >You can get through a full afternoon feeling alert and focused</li>
</ul>
<p>Paying attention to body cues like those is building your Owner's Manual. It's knowing what you need to perform your best, because you've proven to yourself that you know how to do that.</p>
<p>That's the opposite of blindly defaulting to familiar rules and routines.</p>
<p><strong >Keep it simple and do-able.</strong></p>
<p>Try some form of purposeful recovery every day. Start by focusing on just a little bit more recovery.</p>
