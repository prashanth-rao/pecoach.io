<p>Coach's Notes:&nbsp;A little more review of protein and why it's good.</p>

<section id="ember108" >Why protein is important to recovery.</h1> 
<p>Think of your muscles as a house made of bricks.</p> 
<p>Those bricks are&nbsp;<strong >amino acids</strong>—the building blocks of proteins.</p> 
<p>Almost all structures of the body are made up of proteins. You're a living, moving house of mostly protein and water, with a few lipids (fats) and minerals in the mix.</p> 
<p>Protein is pretty important.</p> 
<p>For example, if you start to eat more lean protein, you'll probably notice positive changes. Maybe...</p> 
<ul type=disc > 
<li >You feel more satisfied with meals</li> 
<li >Your hair is growing better</li> 
<li >Your fingernails are growing stronger, or breaking less</li> 
<li >You don't get sick as often</li> 
<li >Your moods are more stable or predictable</li> 
</ul> 
<p>Most importantly for right now, protein helps muscles recover, because protein (in the form of amino acids) provides the bricks to build muscle.</p> 
</section>
<section id="ember109" > 
<h1 >Protein: The revolving door</h1> 
<p>Proteins in our bodies are constantly being broken down and rebuilt, in a process known as protein turnover. According to your tissues, you're literally a different person today than you were yesterday.</p> 
<p>If we get enough protein, then things are good. However, if we don't replace key amino acids (i.e., the &quot;bricks&quot;) that are broken-down through normal protein turnover, then our bodies can't rebuild. Recovery suffers.</p> 
</section>
<section id="ember110" > 
<h1 >Replacing essential building blocks</h1> 
<p>There are several essential amino acids (EAAs) that we must get from food because our bodies don't produce them internally.</p> 
<p>If you're eating various types of lean protein sources, you'll get all the essential amino acids you need.</p> 
</section>
<section id="ember111" > 
<h1 >Amino acids: Powerful recovery tools</h1> 
<p>Eating protein regularly doesn't just keep you feeling full longer. It also means those amino acids are floating around, ready to go to work to replenish your muscles, when you need them.</p> 
<p>This helps recovery. You get stronger and fitter. Your muscles rebuild. And you live to fight another day. Protein victory.</p>
