<section id="ember121" >How good stress builds you up, and bad stress breaks you down.</h1>
<p><strong >You vs. the deadlift</strong></p>
<p>It's high noon at the ranch. The sun beats down. A tumbleweed rolls past. You stand, arms akimbo, facing your mortal enemy: the deadlift.</p>
<p>You wiggle your fingers at your sides, readying your liftin' hands.</p>
<p>Your heart is pounding. You're sweating. Adrenaline is coursing through your veins. The saccharine pop music on the gym's radio is getting on your nerves.</p>
<p>You make your move.</p>
<p>You grab the bar, drop your hips, and with a mighty snort and heave, drive the weight skyward. You rep and rep. Your heart is smashing into your ribcage, trying to pump enough oxygen for your straining muscles.</p>
<p>Eventually, the juice runs out. You're done.</p>
<p>What just happened, physiologically? (Other than you going medieval on that barbell's ass.)</p>
</section>
<section id="ember122" >
<h1 >Your body on exercise</h1>
<p>When you work out, especially intensely, there's a storm of physiological processes happening. Here's a few more notable body effects.</p>
<p><strong >Hormones</strong></p>
<p>Intense exercise—especially exercise that makes you feel excited or anxious, like facing a tough deadlift set or round of sprints—releases catecholamines and glucocorticoids.</p>
<p>Catecholamines are the &quot;go hormones&quot;—your fight-or-flight chemicals that give you a quick blast of energy when you need it.</p>
<p>One catecholamine is adrenaline, aka epinephrine. A burst of adrenaline dumps sugar into your blood for fast-acting fuel, kills pain, and makes you feel temporarily invincible.</p>
<p>Glucocorticoids—such as cortisol—free up blood sugar for you to use.</p>
<p><strong >Motor neurons</strong></p>
<p>Neurons are the &quot;wires&quot; that drive the machine. When they fire, their signals tell your muscles to move.</p>
<p>The more challenging and/or forceful the movement, the more action has to happen in the nervous system: both in the brain and spinal cord (your central nervous system) and the motor neurons attached to your muscles (your peripheral nervous system).</p>
<p>A set of heavy deadlifts requires your neurons to fire fast enough and in a sufficiently organized fashion to get all the muscle pieces moving together and in the right direction.</p>

<p> </p>
<p><strong >Muscle breakdown</strong></p>
<p>Muscular work creates microtrauma—damage at the cellular level.</p>
<p>When muscle cells tear from exercise, they excrete waste products. Their amino acid building blocks are knocked out all over the place. It's a big mess.</p>
</section>
<section id="ember125" >
<h1 >And then, recovery</h1>
<p><strong >There's major, lasting benefits to all this disorder.</strong></p>
<p>Your body needs those mechanical signals of strength training and exercise in order to fire these basic physiological processes. The exercise isn't <em >only</em> making you jacked. It's also tuning all of your internal processes—like hormone and neuron signaling, muscle regeneration—to function optimally throughout the day. If your body didn't get the workouts, those processes would be slow, dormant, or out of alignment.</p>
<p>Then, as your body rebuilds from the stress of the exercise, you get stronger (aka, you get jacked. Bam.).</p>
</section>
<section id="ember126" >
<h1 >Good stress vs. bad stress</h1>
<p>There are a couple of key features that differentiate good from bad stress. Generally,</p>
<ul type=disc >
<li ><strong >Good stress builds you up over time, and is short and intense.</strong></li>
<li ><strong >Bad stress breaks you down over time, and is chronic and on-going.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>The hormonal and physiological changes that happen in a single workout are &quot;good&quot; if that workout is a manageable intensity that you recover within a reasonable amount of time.</p>
<p>The changes are &quot;bad&quot; if that workout is too long, too frequent, always too hard, and if you don't recover properly afterwards. (The stress could also be &quot;bad&quot; if the workout isn't challenging <em >enough</em>, and if you spend a lot of mental stress wondering and worrying about &quot;doing everything perfectly&quot;.)</p>
<p><strong >The main factor that turns bad stress into good stress is being able to properly recover from within a reasonable amount of time.</strong></p>
<p>In other words, assess the appropriate stress level of your workouts by how you're feeling and recovering in the days afterwards.</p>
<p>How's your sleep? How's your eating? How are your all-day energy levels? Are you able to maintain those factors at a level sufficient to you, and meet the rest of your lifestyle goals outside of working out? Judging by your recovery, could you have worked out harder?</p>
<p>Then, adjust workouts accordingly to meet your goals.</p>
</section>
<section id="ember127" >
<p>There are some differences between good (acute) stress and bad (chronic) stress of the physiological processes mentioned above.</p>

<p> </p>
<h1 >Tune in, turn off and chill out</h1>
<p>Recovery is both a mind and body game. It starts with giving yourself some love and care.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<ul type=disc >
<li >Get quality sleep, as often as you can.</li>
<li >Encourage yourself. Notice when you're being self-critical, and call it out.</li>
<li >See yourself as a courageous and resourceful problem solver.</li>
<li >Relax. Focus on the big picture instead of &quot;wondering and worrying&quot; about small details.</li>
<li >Anticipate, plan, strategize. Be proactive and prepared for problem solving.</li>
<li >Reach out to friends, family, and people you trust. Ask for help. (Even if it's difficult.) (<em >Especially</em> if it's difficult.)</li>
<li >Pay attention to your body signals. (Like pain, or energy, or your third migraine this month.)</li>
<li >Keep moving, as often as you can, in as many ways as you can.</li>
<li >Appreciate movement as a gift rather than a chore.</li>
<li >Play. Yes. This is it! Enjoy.</li>
</ul>

<section id="ember130" >
<h1 >Nourish, fuel and replenish</h1>
<p>Simply eating better will help in big ways. This means:</p>
<ul type=disc >
<li ><strong >Eat enough lean protein.</strong></li>
<li ><strong >Eat plenty of colorful veggies and fruits.</strong></li>
<li ><strong >Keep your carb intake moderate (neither too low nor high), and choose slow-digesting, high-fiber &quot;smart carb&quot; options.</strong></li>
<li ><strong >Drink water.</strong></li>
<li ><strong >Do all of the above </strong><em ><b>consistently</b></em><strong>.</strong></li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="ember131" >
<h1 >What's your recovery plan?</h1>
<p><strong >Today, think about the recovery strategies that are already working well for you.</strong></p>
<p>How can you keep doing those as consistently and effectively as possible?</p>
