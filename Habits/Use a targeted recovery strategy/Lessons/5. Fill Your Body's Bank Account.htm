<section id="ember116" >Replenish your body's &quot;bank account&quot; with targeted recovery.</h1>
<p>In general, having more money in your bank account is better than having less. The same theory goes for your body's recovery capacity.</p>
<p>If you train smart, mix up your physical activities, and recover well, you're making &quot;deposits&quot; into that bank account.</p>
<p>If you train too hard, too often, and don't recover properly, you're making &quot;withdrawals&quot;.</p>
<p><strong >If you want to have a healthy, wealthy body, work on replenishing that bank account with targeted recovery strategies.</strong></p>
<p>Recovery! It's like winning the lottery for your body.</p>
</section>
<section id="ember117" >
<h1 >Find the balance</h1>
<p>How do you make sure that your workouts continue to challenge you enough, but not too much?</p>
<p>Simple: <strong >Match your effort to your recovery ability.</strong></p>
<ul type=disc >
<li >If life is beating you up, don't continue those beatings in the gym.</li>
<li >If you're relaxed, recovered, and ready both mentally and physically, then go for it.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is a balance of pushing boundaries in a sustainable way. What's a sustainable level of challenge for you right now?</p>
<p><strong >For, &quot;sustainable&quot; could mean the difference of not making every workout a test of your moral character.</strong> Keep listening to your body. Maybe, leave a little bit left in that bank account for next time.</p>
<p>How do you know what &quot;too hard&quot; or &quot;too easy&quot; or &quot;just right&quot; is?</p>
<p>Experiment. You need to learn your body's signals. <strong >You need to pay attention to how you feel during and after training.</strong></p>
</section>
<section id="ember118" >
<h1 >During your workout: The RPE scale</h1>
<p>During your workout, you can use what's called an <strong >RPE Scale—a Rating of Perceived Exertion</strong>.</p>
<p>This is your subjective sense of how hard you're working. It's subjective because the same workout may feel harder or easier depending on the total load of accumulated stress on your body (your allostatic load).</p>
<p>On a day you have a migraine and a big report due, an easy workout may feel like a death march. Likewise, on a day when you've had a hearty, healthy breakfast and the sun is shining, you might crush even the scariest training session.</p>
<p>Observe clues like:</p>
<ul type=disc >
<li >your heart rate</li>
<li >your soreness</li>
<li >your energy level</li>
<li >your breathing</li>
<li >your mental state</li>
</ul>
<p>You can use a simple 1 to 10 exertion scale, with 1 being &quot;no effort&quot; and 10 being &quot;the hardest, most awful thing I can imagine; I might drop dead but first I'll vomit up my lung.&quot;</p>

<p> </p>
<p>For a guideline... Most days, shoot for something in the 4 to 7 mid-range. Occasionally, when you're feeling strong, bump it to 8 or 9. If you don't feel so hot, stick with 2 to 3.</p>

<h1 >After your workout: Signs of good recovery</h1>
<p>Here are some cues that will tell you that you're recovering well:</p>
<ul type=disc >
<li ><strong >Feeling &quot;zesty&quot;</strong>—well-rested, energetic, vibrant, ready to rock</li>
<li ><strong >Performing well in the gym</strong>—lifting more weight, workouts feel easier</li>
<li ><strong >Sleeping well</strong></li>
<li ><strong >Relatively low and calm morning heart rate</strong> (an elevated heart rate is a sign of over-training)</li>
<li ><strong >Strong immune system</strong>—you are invincible!</li>
<li ><strong >Consistent good mood</strong>—calm, relaxed, stable and cheerful</li>
<li ><strong >Normal menstrual cycles</strong>, if you should be having them</li>
<li ><strong >Lots of enthusiasm and energy</strong>—you're ready to take on the world</li>
<li ><strong >Well-balanced appetite</strong>—moderately hungry every 4 hours or so</li>
<li ><strong >No injuries or nagging aches and pains</strong> (mild, brief soreness after a workout is fine)</li>
</ul>
<p>Notice the times when you're feeling good.</p>
<p>See if you can figure out what optimizes your recovery, and think about how to reproduce that more efficiently and effectively.</p>
<p>Keep working on learning your body's cues. That's the only way to truly know what's enough for you.</p>
<p>Stay checked in to your physical sensations, your moods, and your overall wellbeing. Learn the signs that will tell you whether to hold 'em or fold 'em in the gym.</p>
</section>
<section id="ember122" >
<h1 >Know when to hold 'em and when to fold 'em</h1>
<p>Recovery isn't all-or-nothing. It's a continuum.</p>
<p>Most of the time, <em >moving is better than not moving</em>.</p>
<p><strong >When you don't feel great, do something physical anyway.</strong></p>
<p>If you hit the gym, take it nice and easy. Often, once you've moved around for 10 minutes or so, you might find more energy or end up having a great workout.</p>
<p>If you need a break from the gym on bummer days, look for some variety. Take a new class or try a new sport. Get outside and go for a walk in the fresh air. Mix it up a little. Have fun!</p>
<p>Sometimes &quot;workout blah&quot; is mental stagnation that can be cleared by moving. Keep moving. Steer dynamically and be creative and flexible.</p>
