<h1 align=center >Expert-Approved Supplements</h1>
<h2 align=center >Here are some supplements that do work.</h2>
<form >
<h1 >
<section id="ember118" >Supplements are supplemental to good nutrition, regular activity, and proper recovery.</h1>
<p>Supplements are almost always optional.</p>
<p><strong >You never </strong><em ><b>have</b></em><strong> to take any of the supplements recommended below to get leaner, healthier, and/or fitter.</strong></p>
<p>That being said, here's the list of <a href="https://www.precisionnutrition.com/supplements" target="_blank" >supplements approved by experts at Precision Nutrition</a>.</p>
</section>
<section id="ember119" >
<h1 >PN-approved supplements</h1>
</section>
<section id="ember120" >
<p><strong >Omega-3 supplement</strong></p>
<p>Fish, krill, and/or algae oil all contain the valuable omega-3 fatty acids EPA and DHA.</p>
<p>EPA and DHA are involved in many metabolic processes in the body, including reducing inflammation.</p>
<p>PN sometimes recommends clients take an EPA/DHA supplement if they are concerned about their fatty acid balance.</p>
<p>If you already eat a diet high in omega-3s (particularly with lots of fresh fish and seafood, and/or grass-fed/pastured meats), then you needn't worry about it.</p>
</section>
<section id="ember121" >
<p><strong >A probiotic supplement (and fermented veggies)</strong></p>
<p>This keeps your intestinal bacteria happy, which means better health, boosted immunity, a well-functioning GI tract, and—possibly—more fat loss.</p>
<p>If you suffer from GI-related problems, have cleaned up your diet/eliminated known food intolerances, or have recently been on a course of antibiotics, these probiotics really help.</p>
<p>You can also incorporate naturally fermented foods into your diet.</p>
<p>Fermented veggies, such as naturally fermented sauerkraut or kimchi, contain a species of bacteria that your intestines particularly love (Lactobacillus plantarum), which doesn't occur in dairy. However, other species of Lactobacillus do seem to have beneficial effects.</p>
</section>
<section id="ember122" >
<p><strong >Greens supplement</strong></p>
<p>These supplements are great—but only if you don't get enough vegetables and fruits (e.g., while traveling). Shoot for your required servings, and fill in the gaps with greens only if you can't get enough.</p>
</section>
<section id="ember123" >
<p><strong >Protein powder</strong></p>
<p>Protein powders provide a lean protein option, especially if you struggle to get other lean protein sources, or are looking for a convenient, portable, non-perishable protein source.</p>
</section>
<section id="ember124" >
<p><strong >Essential amino acids (EAAs)</strong></p>
<p>EAAs help provide amino acids during exercise.</p>
<p>This helps exercise performance, improves muscle and immune system recovery, and can decrease body fat.</p>
<p>(Again, remember to get real food first! EAA supplementation is an advanced strategy.)</p>
</section>
<section id="ember125" >
<p><strong >Multivitamin</strong></p>
<p>If you're:</p>
<ul type=disc >
<li >under stress</li>
<li >eating a relatively poor diet</li>
<li >restricting whole food groups (e.g., following a vegan diet)</li>
<li >having gastrointestinal issues</li>
<li >taking medications that might deplete your nutrients, and/or</li>
<li >training hard...</li>
</ul>
<p>then you could be deficient in some key vitamins and minerals.</p>
<p>If you're concerned about deficiencies, you can try a natural-source multivitamin (and you might want to get tested for vitamin/mineral status so that you know for sure).</p>
<p>Remember that with vitamins, more isn't always better. Keep your dose as low as possible to bring yourself up to a normal baseline, and work on boosting your &quot;real food&quot; nutrient intake.</p>
</section>
<section id="ember126" >
<p><strong >Sleep supplements, if you need them</strong></p>
<p>First, prioritize the basics of good sleep hygiene and working on de-stressing. If you've done all that and still can't sleep...</p>
</section>
<section id="ember127" >
<p><strong >Caffeine, in small amounts, as a &quot;workout booster&quot;</strong></p>
<p>If you're dragging butt and need a little kick-start before your workout, you can use a little caffeine. But go easy on that Starbucks, soldier. 6 to 8 oz of coffee (on hard workout days) is enough.</p>
</section>
<section id="ember128" >
<p><strong >Cocoa or dark chocolate</strong></p>
<p>For women in particular, a little organic raw cocoa powder or dark chocolate daily can help fight cravings and replenish minerals. 70% cacao or higher is better for more nutrients, and less refined sugar if it's in a bar rather than powder form.</p>
<p>If it's a challenge to stop at just one or two squares of chocolate, it's probably not worth the trade-off.</p>
</section>
<section id="ember129" >
<p><strong >Vitamin D</strong></p>
<p>Ideally, get outside every day for some fresh air and sunshine. (Your sleep will be better for it too, as the light will help regulate your circadian rhythms.)</p>
<p>But in the winter when light levels are low vitamin D3 is hard to get from real food, and supplements can close a deficiency gap that the sun's not filling. If you think this may be an issue for you, try taking 2000-3000 IU daily in winter months.</p>
<p>If you suffer from painful periods, some research shows that higher doses of vitamin D premenstrually can help a lot. Experiment thoughtfully and pay attention to what works for you. A starting place could be 4000 IU per day for the week or so before cycles start.</p>
<p>(If you're concerned about the safety of this, the original research on period pain and vitamin D used a single whopping dose of 30,000—yes, thirty thousand—IU premenstrually, with no side effects.)</p>
</section>
<section id="ember130" >
<p><strong >Vitamin B12</strong></p>
<p>If you don't eat animal products, add vitamin B12 to your diet (or make sure it's in your multivitamin). This as an essential vitamin that only comes from animal or algae sources.</p>
</section>
<section id="ember131" >
<p><strong >Creatine</strong></p>
<p>If you're covering all of the basics of good nutrition, consistently, and looking for improved workout performance and recovery, creatine is a common supplement that could be helpful in short, high-intensity efforts, increasing protein synthesis and glycogen storage.</p>
<p>However, be aware that creatine can often change your fluid balance. Factor that in before you step on the scale or train in a dehydrating environment.</p>
