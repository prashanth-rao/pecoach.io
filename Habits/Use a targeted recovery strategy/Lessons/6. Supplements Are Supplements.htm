<h1 align=center >Supplements Are Supplements</h1>
<h2 align=center >Supplements are an addition to a good foundation, not a substitute for good nutrition nor a magic bullet.</h2>
<form >
<h1 >
<section id="ember120" >Choose supplements thoughtfully.</h1>
<p>If you're tuned to pop culture, you may have seen some stories of amazing body transformations. People who are able to change their lifestyles so much that they lose hundreds of pounds and shred excess fat.</p>
<p>It's tempting to think that these folks were special, or non-human, not like you, that maybe those people were doing a little something... extra.</p>
<p>Did they have a special protein powder? Did they know some ancient Chinese herbal medical secret? Were they taking &quot;fat burners&quot; or &quot;metabolism accelerators&quot; out of their fridge that looks like a medicine cabinet?</p>
<p>Will you need to remortgage your house or get a chemistry degree to support a supplement program and lose weight?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Supplements are additional to whole nutrition. They're a minor detail, not a major principle. Supplements are almost always completely optional.</p>
<p><strong >To cover the principles first, focus on improving food awareness, basic daily practices, and consistency before considering additional supplements.</strong></p>
<p>Choose supplements thoughtfully, based on what <em >you</em> need and aren't currently getting from whole food options.</p>

<h1 >What it takes to be an informed supplement consumer.</h1>
<p>While it might seem like supplements are confusing and complicated, the guidelines for finding junk supplements is the same as finding junk food.</p>
<ul type=disc >
<li >Read labels.</li>
<li >Avoid excess ingredients.</li>
<li >Find trusted brands.</li>
<li >Think about whether food X or supplement Y really helps you meet your goals.</li>
<li >Stay aware and ask, &quot;<em >How's this working for me?</em>&quot;</li>
</ul>

<h1 >What's in that bottle?</h1>
<p><strong >The supplement industry is very poorly regulated.</strong></p>
<p>In most countries, supplements fall into a gray area. They aren't exactly foods. They aren't exactly drugs. As a result, they aren't controlled by the same, relatively strict regulations that cover food and drugs.</p>
<p>For instance, if you buy a can of tomatoes or a bottle of ibuprofen, laws and regulations cover:</p>
<ul type=disc >
<li ><strong >What can be on the label</strong>: If the can says tomatoes, it must be tomatoes and not pickles.</li>
<li ><strong >How much can be in the can or dose</strong>: You can't buy 5000 mg ibuprofen pills, and if the can says 500 g of tomatoes, the manufacturers can't fill the can half-full of tomatoes.</li>
<li ><strong >The purity of the product</strong>: Your tomatoes can't have chunks of rat in them. The ibuprofen can't be spiked with heroin.</li>
<li ><strong >What the label can claim</strong>: Ibuprofen can only claim to alleviate pain and inflammation; it can't claim to cure cancer.</li>
</ul>
<p>Supplements aren't covered by any of these regulations. Instead, for supplements...</p>
<ul type=disc >
<li ><strong >Anything can be on the label.</strong> What's on the label may or may not be what's in the bottle.</li>
<li ><strong >The dose can vary wildly between batches.</strong> There's little standardization.</li>
<li ><strong >The product doesn't have to be pure.</strong> You don't know what really is in that bottle. Nor can you trust the purity of the ingredients. In fact, something labeled &quot;Product X&quot; may contain almost no &quot;Product X&quot; at all.</li>
<li ><strong >The product can have ingredients not on the label</strong>, including banned ingredients. These can cause problems for drug tests and allergic reactions.</li>
<li ><strong >The product may be full of things you don't want</strong>, such as sugar, artificial sweeteners, glycerin, soy, or artificial colours.</li>
<li ><strong >The label can claim all kinds of things</strong>: &quot;fat scorching&quot;; &quot;muscle amping&quot;; &quot;will turn you into a raging beast&quot;, and so forth.</li>
<li >In the United States, <strong >a supplement doesn't have to be proven safe before it can be sold</strong>. The federal Food and Drug Administration must prove that the supplement isn't safe—i.e., after consumers have complained, or someone's gotten sick. And even then, the FDA has almost no power to remove unsafe supplements from the shelves.</li>
</ul>

<h1 >Supplement supply chain</h1>
<p>In the film <em >Bigger Faster Stronger</em>, documentary filmmaker Chris Bell explores the supplement industry, eventually showing how easy it is to make his own &quot;supplements&quot;.</p>
<p>He hires casual laborers to fill capsules full of rice flour in his kitchen, then prints fancy labels listing a &quot;proprietary blend&quot; of secret ingredients.</p>
<p>What costs him $1.40 to make, he says he can sell for $60.</p>
<p>Bell's experiment is satirical, but the reality isn't very funny. Consumer Reports has found that:</p>
<ul type=disc >
<li >Supplements contaminated with heavy metals, pesticides, or prescription drugs (including anabolic steroids or their precursors—bad news for any drug-tested athletes) have been sold to unsuspecting consumers.</li>
<li >Rules covering manufacturing quality don't apply to the companies that supply herbs, vitamins, and other raw ingredients.</li>
<li >Of the more than 54,000 dietary supplement products in the Natural Medicines Comprehensive Database, only about a third have some level of safety and effectiveness that is supported by scientific evidence. Nearly 12% have been linked to safety concerns or problems with product quality.</li>
<li >The United States FDA recently estimated that there are more than 50,000 minor and serious health problems a year related to dietary supplements.</li>
</ul>

<h1 >How do you know what's safe?</h1>
<p>In the United States, look for the USP certification on the label. This indicates that US Pharmacopeia, an independent agency, has certified the supplement through its Dietary Supplement Verification Program. (To see a list of products, check the <a href="https://www.usp.org/" target="_blank" >website</a>.)</p>

<p> </p>
<p>In Canada, Health Canada regulates dietary supplements. Look for the following on the label:</p>
<ul type=disc >
<li >a Drug Identification Number (DIN)</li>
<li >a Natural Product Number (NPN), or</li>
<li >a Homeopathic Medicine Number (DIN-HM)</li>
</ul>

<p> </p>
<p>In Europe, the European Commission's Food Safety Authority regulates, to some degree, vitamin and mineral supplements, but &quot;botanicals&quot; or &quot;nutraceuticals&quot; are less well regulated.</p>
<p>Labeling rules vary among member states and often depend on what the product claims to do—for instance, in the UK, garlic is sold as an immune booster, while in Germany it's sold as a treatment for cardiovascular disease. Some countries, such as The Netherlands, ban only a few substances that are known to be actively harmful.</p>
<p>You can also look for the &quot;GMP&quot; sticker, which means &quot;Good Manufacturing Practices&quot;. Or check <a href="https://www.consumerreports.org/cro/index.htm" target="_blank" >Consumer Reports</a> to see whether your dietary supplement is listed.</p>

<p> </p>
<p>Don't forget to look for other filler ingredients on the label. They may not always be listed, but you can be sure if it says &quot;sugar&quot;, you should put the bottle back on the shelf.</p>

<h1 >Special considerations for athletes</h1>
<p><strong >If you compete in a drug-tested sport, be extra careful.</strong></p>
<p>A 2001 study pulled 634 random supplements—protein powders, recovery drinks, etc.—from the shelves in 13 countries. Of those, 94 samples contained chemicals that could lead to a positive drug test, while 66 more were considered &quot;questionable&quot;.</p>
<p>Accidentally testing positive for banned substances is something that can ruin dreams.</p>
<p>If you're an athlete, use supplements that are certified clean for sport by the NSF or HFL, two independent research labs that test and certify. Here's where you can learn more about <a href="http://info.nsf.org/Certified/BannedSub/Listings.asp" target="_blank" >NSF tested products</a>. And here's where you can find a full listing of the <a href="https://www.informed-sport.com/supplement_search" target="_blank" >HFL tested products</a>.</p>

<h1 >Bottom line: Be a critical consumer</h1>
<p>Buy from reputable distributors and manufacturers. Don't hesitate to contact companies and ask about their manufacturing process, and/or where they get their ingredients. Be skeptical and ask questions.</p>
