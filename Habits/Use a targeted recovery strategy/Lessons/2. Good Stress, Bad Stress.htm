<section id="ember117" >We <em >all</em> need recovery.</h1>
<p>You might be thinking: Well, I don't have to worry about recovery!</p>
<ul type=disc >
<li >I'm older. Supplements are for younguns.</li>
<li >I'm younger. I'm immortal!</li>
<li >I'm an average Jane or Joe. How much could it matter?</li>
<li >I'm a superhero. (OK, fair enough, if you're Wolverine, you don't need to worry about recovery. Everyone else has to.)</li>
<li >I just like to stay in shape.</li>
<li >I'm not training like an Olympic athlete!</li>
</ul>
<p>Think again. All of us (except Wolverine, who may be excused from class today) need to care about recovery. But not all recovery—or, for that matter, all stress—is created equal.</p>

<h1 >The allostatic load</h1>
<p>Grab a piece of paper and write down all the things in your average day that could possibly be a stress on your body and mind. That includes physical, emotional, and mental stressors.</p>
<p>Your list might look something like this:</p>
<ul type=disc >
<li >Boss yelled at me</li>
<li >Rushing around to meetings</li>
<li >Worrying about money</li>
<li >Commuting</li>
<li >Crummy weather</li>
<li >Kid woke me up early</li>
<li >Girlfriend/boyfriend snarked at me this morning</li>
<li >I think I might've eaten some bad shrimp salad</li>
</ul>
<p>If you're like most people, you're a camel carrying a big load of straw with these combined life stresses.</p>
<p>Now imagine what could happen if you start piling on more straw with physical stress from your workouts and eating less healthy food.</p>
<p>Eventually... <em >snap</em>.</p>
<p>The pile of straw is your <em >allostatic load</em>: the cumulative total of all the stuff in your life that causes physical, mental, and/or emotional stress.</p>
</section>
<section id="ember119" >
<h1 >Good stress, bad stress</h1>
<p>Some stress is good stress. Good stress pushes you out of your comfort zone, but in a good way. Good stress helps you learn, grow, and get stronger.</p>
<p>For example, riding a roller coaster is fun and exciting. It lasts a short time, and you feel exhilarated afterwards. (That is, if you like roller coasters.)</p>
<p>Exercise can be another form of good stress. You feel a little uncomfortable but then you feel good, and after an hour or so, you're done.</p>
<p>Good stress:</p>
<ul type=disc >
<li >is short-lived</li>
<li >is infrequent</li>
<li >is over quickly (in a matter of minutes or hours)</li>
<li >can be part of a positive life experience</li>
<li >helps build you up—it leaves you better than you were before</li>
</ul>
<p>But let's say you ride that roller coaster constantly, or lift weights 4 hours a day, every day.</p>
<p>Now it doesn't seem so fun, does it?</p>
<p>Bad stress:</p>
<ul type=disc >
<li >lasts a long time</li>
<li >is chronic</li>
<li >is ongoing</li>
<li >is negative, depressing, and demoralizing</li>
<li >breaks you down—it leaves you worse off than you were before</li>
</ul>
<p>One key feature that distinguishes good from bad stress is <strong >how well the stressor matches your ability to recover from it</strong>.</p>
</section>
<section id="ember120" >
<h1 >Where's your &quot;recovery zone&quot;?</h1>
<p>Each of us has a unique &quot;recovery zone&quot;. Our recovery zone depends on several factors such as:</p>
<ul type=disc >
<li >our age</li>
<li >our natural personality type (i.e., are we adventure-seeking adrenaline junkies or homebodies who prefer calm and quiet?)</li>
<li >our &quot;stress resilience&quot;—how well we cope with and rebound from stress overall</li>
<li >our total allostatic load—what else is going on in our lives</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="ember121" >
<div class='figure'><img src='https://prashanth-rao.github.io/pecoach.io/Resource/img/050f7fa8-de53-4df2-93b5-937a06a30655.png' width=100%></div>
<p> </p>
<p>If the stressor is <strong >too low</strong>—not enough to cause a reaction—then nothing will happen. You'll go along the same as before, no better or worse.</p>
<p>If the stressor is <strong >too high</strong>—too strong, and/or lasts too long, outpacing your recovery ability—then you'll eventually break down.</p>
<p>If the stressor is <strong >within your recovery zone</strong>—neither too much nor too little, and doesn't last too long—then you'll recover from it and get better. What doesn't kill you makes you stronger!</p>
<p>Here's the key: <strong >that optimum zone depends on your allostatic load</strong>.</p>
<p>If your existing pile of straw is already heavy, then it'll take only a few more straws to break you.</p>
<p>In order to not break you, make sure that your workout is good stress, not bad stress.</p>
<p>Also, to make sure your camel spine stay strong and flexible, prop it up with good nutrition and recovery practices.</p>
