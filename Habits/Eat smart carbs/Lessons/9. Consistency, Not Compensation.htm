<h1 >You can't out-train a poor diet.</h1>
<p>(Though most of us have tried.)</p>
<p>No matter how hard you bust your butt in the gym or on the track, a lean body and top athletic performance comes mostly from smart food choices.</p>
<p>Exercising to &quot;burn calories&quot; or make up for &quot;mistakes&quot; doesn't work in the long run.</p>
<p>Not only does that turn movement into a chore and eating into a sin, but it eventually makes you feel run down and hungrier than ever.</p>
<p>Start fitness in the kitchen.</p>
<ul type=disc >
<li ><strong >Choose foods that nourish you and add value to your body.</strong></li>
<li ><strong >Eat slowly and mindfully.</strong></li>
<li ><strong >Enjoy exercise and movement because it makes you stronger, fitter, and healthier.</strong> (Instead of trying to &quot;work off&quot; something &quot;bad&quot;.) Separate movement from food, and enjoy them both for the value they offer to your body.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="ember110" >
<h1 >Focus on consistency, not compensation.</h1>
<p>As the saying goes, an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.</p>
<p><strong >Consistency (i.e. small daily actions you do every day) works better than compensation (i.e. frantically trying to make up for a &quot;mistake&quot;).</strong></p>
<p>Most people feel better when they focus on consistency. More in control. More relaxed. More content.</p>
<p>You’re also more likely to do the things you need and want to do to move towards your goals.</p>
<p><strong >You’ll look for ways to just do something every day, or as regularly as possible.</strong></p>
<p>For instance, your practice might be:</p>
<ul type=disc >
<li >Get at least some movement today, even if that’s 5 minutes.</li>
<li >Eat at least one fruit or vegetable today.</li>
<li >Drink a big glass of water when I wake up.</li>
<li >Eat a little bit more slowly or mindfully.</li>
<li >Have a smaller portion of dessert, or skip it every other day.</li>
</ul>
<p>And so on.</p>
<p>These actions might seem small and unambitious, but that’s exactly why they get done.</p>
<p><strong >Things that get done, over and over, add up.</strong> They also become a seamless part of your routine, so they become easier and more automatic. Over time, these healthy habits become part of who you are, rather than an excruciating daily effort.</p>
<p><strong >Doing the things leads to results.</strong> These results might not be immediate nor spectacular, but they’ll be real, and they’ll last.</p>
<p>Conversely, if you’re always compensating or swinging wildly between all or nothing, you’re probably spending an awful lot of time not doing any the practices that help you.</p>

<section id="ember111" >
<h1 >Help yourself get things done, consistently.</h1>
<p><strong >Anticipate. Prepare. Strategize.</strong></p>
<p>When you’re done reading this, go look at your calendar.</p>
<ul type=disc >
<li >What’s coming up in the next while?</li>
<li >How can you help yourself stay on track?</li>
<li >What do you need to do today . . . and tomorrow . . . and the next few days . . . to help yourself make small but wise choices, consistently?</li>
</ul>
<p>And… how could you make movement something that you do simply because it’s good for you, and you enjoy it?</p>
