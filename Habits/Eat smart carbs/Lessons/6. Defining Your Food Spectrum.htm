<h1 align=center >Defining Your Food Spectrum</h1> 
<h2 align=center >Instead of focusing on &quot;good&quot; or &quot;bad&quot; foods, try to make your choices just a little bit better.</h2> 
<p>Coach's Notes:&nbsp;Reviewing the idea of a &quot;food continuum&quot; where choices are &quot;better&quot; and &quot;worse&quot; rather than &quot;good&quot; / &quot;bad&quot;. Asks clients to consider what is &quot;a little bit better&quot; in any given situation.</p>

<section id="ember116" >Practice thinking of all food on a spectrum from&nbsp;<em >better</em>&nbsp;to&nbsp;<em >worse</em>.</h1> 
<p>Rather than foods being black or white, “good” or “bad” ...</p> 
<ul type=disc > 
<li ><strong >Some foods feel good and work well for you.</strong>&nbsp;They add health, boost your performance, improve your recovery, and/or help your body do its job. (Better.)</li> 
<li ><strong >Some foods don’t feel good and don’t work well for you.</strong>&nbsp;They take away health, impair your performance, and/or clog up your body’s machinery. (Worse.)</li> 
</ul> 
<p>It’s not “all-or-nothing”. There’s no “best” or “perfect” food or meal. There’s no rules or “shoulds”.</p> 
<p>Instead:</p> 
<p><strong >We make choices in each situation, trying to move along the continuum to “just a little bit better”, as often as possible.</strong></p> 
<p>What’s&nbsp;<em >your</em>&nbsp;criteria for what makes a food “better” or “worse”?</p> 
<p>For instance:</p> 
<ul type=disc > 
<li >Gives me energy (better) versus takes energy away (worse).</li> 
<li >Lots of health-promoting nutrients (better) versus few to no nutrients (worse).</li> 
<li >Digests well (better) versus upsets my stomach (worse).</li> 
<li >I can eat it calmly and sanely (better) versus one bite leads to a binge (worse).</li> 
</ul> 
<p>It’s your game. You can play it the way you want.</p> 
<p><strong >What’s “better” in a specific context? Why?</strong></p> 
<p>Each situation will have its own “game rules”.</p> 
<p>A choice you make in an airport might be different than a choice in a restaurant, or at home.</p> 
<p><strong >See if you can put each choice on the food spectrum, and figure out why you'd put it there.</strong></p> 
</section>

<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The point of the game isn't necessarily to always have &quot;better&quot; choices. (Although that's always a good goal.)</p> 
<p>The more important point is to understand&nbsp;<strong >why</strong>. With the clarity of what “better” means to you, you can make your choices conscious and purposeful, rather than random, accidental, or &quot;I dunno&quot;.</p> 
</section>
<section id="ember119" > 
<h1 >A few more questions to ask yourself as you decide what’s “better”:</h1> 
<p><strong >What’s in the food?</strong></p> 
<ul type=disc > 
<li >How is this food made?</li> 
<li >How processed is this food (or not)?</li> 
<li >What's in this food? (Or not in it?)</li> 
</ul> 
<p><strong >How does this food work with me?</strong></p> 
<ul type=disc > 
<li >How does this food affect my body? How do I feel physically after eating it?</li> 
<li >Does this food, fundamentally, nourish me? Does it add or subtract value?</li> 
<li >Do I find it easy or difficult to eat this food slowly and sanely?</li> 
<li >Do I truly enjoy or value this food?</li> 
</ul> 
<p><strong >Where does this food fit on a continuum of “worse” or “better”?</strong></p> 
<ul type=disc > 
<li >What’s the situation I’m in right now? What are the options I have available in that situation?</li> 
<li >What are the “worse” or “better” options in this situation?</li> 
<li >With some creativity, could I expand or improve those options?</li> 
</ul> 
<p>Here’s a video that gives you some examples of the spectrum of “better” to “worse”.</p>
