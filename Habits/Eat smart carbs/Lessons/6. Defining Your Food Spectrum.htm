<h1 align=center >Defining Your Food Spectrum</h1>
<h2 align=center >Instead of focusing on &quot;good&quot; or &quot;bad&quot; foods, try to make your choices just a little bit better.</h2>
<form >
<h1 >
<section id="ember116" >Practice thinking of all food on a spectrum from <em >better</em> to <em >worse</em>.</h1>
<p>Rather than foods being black or white, “good” or “bad” ...</p>
<ul type=disc >
<li ><strong >Some foods feel good and work well for you.</strong> They add health, boost your performance, improve your recovery, and/or help your body do its job. (Better.)</li>
<li ><strong >Some foods don’t feel good and don’t work well for you.</strong> They take away health, impair your performance, and/or clog up your body’s machinery. (Worse.)</li>
</ul>
<p>It’s not “all-or-nothing”. There’s no “best” or “perfect” food or meal. There’s no rules or “shoulds”.</p>
<p>Instead:</p>
<p><strong >We make choices in each situation, trying to move along the continuum to “just a little bit better”, as often as possible.</strong></p>
<p>What’s <em >your</em> criteria for what makes a food “better” or “worse”?</p>
<p>For instance:</p>
<ul type=disc >
<li >Gives me energy (better) versus takes energy away (worse).</li>
<li >Lots of health-promoting nutrients (better) versus few to no nutrients (worse).</li>
<li >Digests well (better) versus upsets my stomach (worse).</li>
<li >I can eat it calmly and sanely (better) versus one bite leads to a binge (worse).</li>
</ul>
<p>It’s your game. You can play it the way you want.</p>
<p><strong >What’s “better” in a specific context? Why?</strong></p>
<p>Each situation will have its own “game rules”.</p>
<p>A choice you make in an airport might be different than a choice in a restaurant, or at home.</p>
<p><strong >See if you can put each choice on the food spectrum, and figure out why you'd put it there.</strong></p>

<div class='figure'><img src='https://prashanth-rao.github.io/pecoach.io/Resource/img/997647e5-bbba-4d9d-ab49-a49860c42777.png' width=100%></div>
<p> </p>
<p>The point of the game isn't necessarily to always have &quot;better&quot; choices. (Although that's always a good goal.)</p>
<p>The more important point is to understand <strong >why</strong>. With the clarity of what “better” means to you, you can make your choices conscious and purposeful, rather than random, accidental, or &quot;I dunno&quot;.</p>
</section>
<section id="ember119" >
<h1 >A few more questions to ask yourself as you decide what’s “better”:</h1>
<p><strong >What’s in the food?</strong></p>
<ul type=disc >
<li >How is this food made?</li>
<li >How processed is this food (or not)?</li>
<li >What's in this food? (Or not in it?)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong >How does this food work with me?</strong></p>
<ul type=disc >
<li >How does this food affect my body? How do I feel physically after eating it?</li>
<li >Does this food, fundamentally, nourish me? Does it add or subtract value?</li>
<li >Do I find it easy or difficult to eat this food slowly and sanely?</li>
<li >Do I truly enjoy or value this food?</li>
</ul>
<p><strong >Where does this food fit on a continuum of “worse” or “better”?</strong></p>
<ul type=disc >
<li >What’s the situation I’m in right now? What are the options I have available in that situation?</li>
<li >What are the “worse” or “better” options in this situation?</li>
<li >With some creativity, could I expand or improve those options?</li>
</ul>
<p>Here’s a video that gives you some examples of the spectrum of “better” to “worse”.</p>

<p>See if you can figure out where your food fits today, and why.</p>
