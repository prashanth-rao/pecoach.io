<section id="ember133" >Carbohydrates aren’t an all-or-nothing game.</h1>
<p><strong >If you’re new to improving your carbohydrate intake:</strong></p>
<p>Focus on:</p>
<ul type=disc >
<li >Making each carb choice just a little bit better.</li>
<li >Experimenting with options that work for you.</li>
<li >Getting an appropriate portion size for your needs.</li>
</ul>
<p>For most women, about 1 cupped handful of slow-digesting, nutrient-rich, high-fiber smart carbs per meal is a great starting point.</p>
<p>For most men, about 2 cupped handfuls of smart carbs per meal may be closer to appropriate servings.</p>
<p>Depending on your size, goals, and preferences, start with about 1-2 servings per meal, pay attention to how that affects you, and adjust with your coach accordingly.</p>

<p><strong >If you feel you're doing well getting the right carb type in the right portions,</strong></p>
<p>Then focus on:</p>
<ul type=disc >
<li >Being consistent.</li>
<li >Trying new varieties and expanding your repertoire.</li>
<li >Making food prep more effective and efficient.</li>
</ul>
<p>Whatever you choose, continue to practice the basics of quality and quanity.</p>

<h1 >Think on a continuum.</h1>
<p>Not every meal will have the “perfect” amount of smart carbs. (Partly because there’s no such thing as &quot;perfect&quot;...)</p>
<p>You might not even want smart carbs at some meals. Maybe you just feel like having a salad and some shrimp or tofu right now.</p>
<p>That’s where guidelines and a template wins: it isn't rules. It's a loose blueprint that you can play with and adjust. Experiment to find what you like. Keep gathering data about what works for you.</p>
<p><strong >Dial the carbohydrates up or down.</strong></p>
<p>As you move along the continuum, you can try adjusting the amount of carbohydrate, the type, and even when you eat them (for instance, more with some meals rather than others).</p>
<p>If you dial up (i.e. more carbs), add higher-fiber, slow-digesting &quot;smart carbs&quot; such as starchy tubers, whole grains, beans and legumes, and/or fruit.</p>
<p>If you dial down (i.e. fewer carbs), stuff those meals full of delicious colorful veggies.</p>
<p><strong >Learning adaptability in meals and menus.</strong></p>
<p>Neither high nor lower carb menus are &quot;good&quot; or &quot;bad” for everyone all the time. (However, most people don’t do well with no or very low carbs in their diets.)</p>
<p>By experimenting with options you're expanding your awareness and exploring what works for you.</p>
<p><strong >Experiment. And have fun.</strong></p>
