<section id="ember119" >Trying to change your habits, you may be surprised to meet our “inner child”.</h1>
<p>In the middle of learning to leave without old habits, our toddler selves might be pouting, saying “No! Mine!”, kicking our heels on the floor, and whining.</p>
<p><em >Waaaaaah! I wanna cookie!</em></p>
<p>Or, maybe our adolescent selves might be wanting to rebel, break rules, or shock imaginary parents who are, like, toooootally boring and stupid and don’t understand anything.</p>
<p><em >This sucks! You can't tell me what to do! I'm eating candy anyway!</em></p>

<h1 >What's your &quot;same old story&quot;?</h1>
<p>If you notice your inner brat appearing sometimes, don’t worry.</p>
<p>It can often happen when you try to adjust to a &quot;new normal&quot; and try to break old habits.</p>
<p>In part, this is because we’re often making decisions about today, or tomorrow, based on old stories that we learned a long time ago.</p>
<p><strong >We might have learned stories or scripts about how things &quot;should&quot; go, or how things have gone in the past.</strong></p>
<p>Perhaps stories like this:</p>
<ol start=1 type=1 style='box-sizing: border-box;margin-bottom:1rem;line-height:
var(--text-line-height-m);counter-reset: li 0'>
<li >In order to lose weight / be healthy, I have to deprive myself.</li>
<li >This deprivation should be very strict. I have to make a lot of rules!</li>
<li >These rules are &quot;all or nothing&quot;. If I break the rules, even just a little, then I am bad and &quot;off plan&quot;.</li>
<li >Once I am &quot;off plan&quot;, then $%#! it!! I am eating whatever I want!</li>
<li >Ugh. I feel awful. I am weak. I always fail. There is no hope for me.</li>
<li >Wait… I probably need more rules.</li>
<li >In order to lose weight / be healthy, I have to deprive myself further.</li>
</ol>
<p>And so it goes.</p>
<p>Kind of a lousy story actually.</p>
<p><strong >Relying on past stories and scripts to tell us how to act now rarely helps us.</strong></p>
<p>This is especially true if we’re trying to change… because we’re now experimenting with something new.</p>
<p><strong >One problem is that we can’t always use the past to predict the future.</strong></p>
<p>Your story may have been written when you were 5, or 10, or 15. It may not be relevant now to you as an adult.</p>
<p><strong >Plus, our brains selectively remember things.</strong></p>
<p>We might remember the bad stuff (“I failed!”) and forget the good stuff (“I tried, and stuck with it”).</p>
<p>Or we might remember that something “worked” (like an extreme diet) when it actually didn’t.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<p><strong >Deprivation, restriction, and &quot;food rules&quot; seem like they should work. But they don't.</strong></p>
<p>There are many reasons why.</p>
<ul type=disc >
<li ><strong >You can’t bully nor belittle anyone into changing, including yourself.</strong> Being extra-strict and self-blaming (aka seeking deprivation) doesn’t work.</li>
<li ><strong >Our bodies evolved mechanisms to prevent starvation.</strong> These mechanisms can shape our thoughts and feelings.</li>
<li ><strong >Underlying this behavior is an assumption: I am deprived.</strong> I can “rebel” or “treat myself” with eating “forbidden foods”.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you focus on all-or-nothing, deprivation-oriented thoughts such as I can never eat carbs or All carbs are bad, then you will be more likely to see carbs as the proverbial “forbidden fruit”.</p>
<p>Your inner child will throw a rebellious tantrum, and you may find yourself reaching defiantly for the sugar bowl.</p>
<p>How's that old story working for you?</p>
<p>Time to try something else?</p>

<h1 >Luckily, we also carry an inner Wise Grownup around with us.</h1>
<p>This is the part of your brain that solves problems, understands cause and effect, thinks about long-term consequences, and acts like a good parent.</p>

<p>Just like a good caregiver knows when their child needs a nap or is cranky and overstimulated after a long day of activities, your grownup brain can recognize, calm, and comfort your kid brain.</p>
</section>
<section id="ember124" >
<h1 >Experiment with a fresh new story.</h1>
<p>Next time you catch yourself thinking $%#! you, I'm eating the cake! or Me want a treat! stop for a second, and tap in to that caring, supportive Wise Inner Grownup.</p>
<p>Ask yourself:</p>
<ul type=disc >
<li >How old am I right now? (In other words, am I feeling like a toddler who wants a treat or a rebellious teenager?)</li>
<li >What would my Wise Inner Grownup do or say right now?</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="ember125" >
<p>Hopefully ... your inner caregiver would be kind, loving and compassionate, but honest and firm. They wouldn't let you over-restrict or harm yourself, but they wouldn't let you get away with shenanigans either.</p>
<p>(They might also sit down with you for a compassionate, curious chat to figure out how you’re feeling, and what you need right now.)</p>
<p>Especially if you're a parent role modeling for your kids ... why not start by being your own Wise Inner Parent?</p>
<p><strong >Today, try writing yourself a new, grownup story...</strong></p>
<p>A new story without harsh rules and punishment.</p>
<p>A story that's full of love, wisdom, and compassion.</p>
<p>A story where you sense in to what your body wants and needs, rather than relying on &quot;rules&quot;.</p>
<p>A story that takes you where <strong >you</strong> want to go, following the gentle guidance of your own Wise Inner Parent.</p>
</section>
<section id="ember126" >
<h1 >What are your &quot;same old stories&quot; about food, eating, and your body?</h1>
<p><strong >What's your script for how you think this “should” work?</strong></p>
<p>For example:</p>
<ul type=disc >
<li >Do you expect to feel deprived?</li>
<li >Do you make strict rules or stringent plans?</li>
<li >Do you deny yourself certain foods, but then rebound later on?</li>
<li >Do you engage in all-or-nothing thinking?</li>
<li >Does your inner dialogue about food make you sound younger than 18?</li>
<li >Do you criticize yourself harshly?</li>
</ul>
<p><strong >How is that script or story working for you?</strong></p>
<p>How does it help you? What does it give you?</p>
<p>How does it work against you?</p>
<p>If you tell yourself that script or story for the next 20 years, what might happen?</p>
<p><strong >What happens if you write down or record that script or story?</strong></p>
<p>Try writing down your thoughts and scripts about food, eating, and your body. Then read them. Or dictate to your phone or computer, then play it back.</p>
<p>Seeing our thoughts in writing, or hearing them out loud, can be powerful.</p>
<p>Once you see your stories “on paper” or hear them… does it change your perspective?</p>
<p>Test your stories and &quot;inner voice&quot; assumptions. Is each story completely true, all of the time? How do you know for sure?</p>
<p><strong >What story would you like to have? What could be different?</strong></p>
<p>Stories often start with a prompt, like “Once upon a time…”</p>
<p>What happens if you start a new story with “Hey buddy…”?</p>
<p>Or “Once there was a person who was trying really hard, and ran into some obstacles…”</p>
