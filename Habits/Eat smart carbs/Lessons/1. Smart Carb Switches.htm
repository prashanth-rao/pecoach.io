<p>Coach's Notes:&nbsp;What are &quot;smart carbs&quot;, why are they good, and what are some options for them?</p>

<section id="ember107" >Smart carbs add value to your body and make you healthier.</h1> 
<p><strong >Carbs are your friends.</strong></p> 
<p>And, the more active you are, the better a friend they’ll be.</p> 
<p>Research shows that even if you have hormonal or metabolic issues (such as hypothyroid, PCOS, or problems regulating blood sugar), smart carbs are a valuable part of most people's diets. (Smart carbs may even be&nbsp;<em >especially</em>&nbsp;important if you have those complications).</p> 
<p>There are major health cautions to cutting carbs too low. A relatively small minority of people will look, feel, and perform their best on very low-carb diets.</p> 
<p>When you get enough of the right kinds of carbs, you’re more likely to,</p> 
<ul type=disc > 
<li >be full of energy, zest, and vitality.</li> 
<li >feel calm, relaxed, and sleep well.</li> 
<li >have fewer or less intense sugar cravings.</li> 
<li >have high-functioning hormones are happy.</li> 
<li >kick ass in the gym, on the field, and at life.</li> 
</ul>

<h1 >The carb experiment: Switching to smarter.</h1> 
<p>Focusing on&nbsp;<em >better</em>&nbsp;carbs can be a smarter strategy than focusing on&nbsp;<em >fewer</em>&nbsp;carbs.</p> 
<p>To experiment,</p> 
<ul type=disc > 
<li ><strong >Step 1</strong>: Look at your daily routine and menu.</li> 
<li ><strong >Step 2</strong>: See if you can figure out how to substitute some smarter carbs, and/or make your regular meals just a little bit better.</li> 
</ul> 
<p>For example:</p> 
<p><strong >For a side dish, try:</strong></p> 
<ul type=disc > 
<li >some whole grains (such as brown or wild rice, quinoa, oats, buckwheat groats, sprouted grains, etc.)</li> 
<li >beans/legumes for chickpea hummus</li> 
<li >sweet and/or regular potatoes boiled instead of fried.</li> 
</ul> 
<p><strong >For snacks,</strong></p> 
<ul type=disc > 
<li >Snack on fruit instead of sugary treats when you want something sweet.</li> 
<li >See the list below for more ideas for sugar alternatives.</li> 
</ul> 
<p><strong >For fast meals,</strong></p> 
<ul type=disc > 
<li >Use fruit (or even cooked sweet potatoes) to sweeten a protein shake.</li> 
</ul> 
<p><strong >For breads,</strong></p> 
<ul type=disc > 
<li >Look for whole-grain alternatives to processed white flour products, such as&nbsp;<a href="http://www.foodforlife.com/about_us/ezekiel-49" target="_blank" >Ezekiel bread</a></li> 
</ul> 
<p><strong >For main dishes,</strong></p> 
<ul type=disc > 
<li >Bring legumes into your life with black bean chili, dal or lentil flour chapatis.</li> 
<li >Have some steel-cut or old-fashioned oats (or something truly whole-grain, like&nbsp;<a href="http://holycrap.ca/" target="_blank" >Holy Crap</a>&nbsp;instead of regular sugary breakfast cereal.</li> 
<li ><a href="http://www.explorecuisine.com/en/products/bean-pastas.html" target="_blank" >Bean pasta</a>&nbsp;— it even gives you an extra serving of protein.</li> 
</ul>

<h1 >High ROI switches: Substitute smart carbs for sugar.</h1> 
<p>Finding smart carb alternatives to foods high in refined sugar can be some of the most nutritionally rewarding switches.</p> 
<p>For example,</p> 
<p><strong >For cakes, pastries, or muffins,</strong></p> 
<ul type=disc > 
<li >Try higher-fiber flours such as quinoa flour, buckwheat flour, coconut flour, brown rice flour, or even whole-wheat flour.</li> 
<li >Experiment with baking with sweet potatoes.</li> 
</ul> 
<p><strong >For cookies and bars, including protein bars</strong></p> 
<ul type=disc > 
<li >Try ideas from&nbsp;<a href="http://proteinpow.com/" target="_blank" >Protein Pow</a>: Like Oatmeal Raisin Protein cookies, Chocolate Fudge Muffins, or any of the other awesome recipes at Protein Pow.</li> 
</ul> 
<p><strong >For ice cream,</strong></p> 
<ul type=disc > 
<li >Try some&nbsp;<a href="http://www.precisionnutrition.com/pn-ice-cream" target="_blank" >protein ice cream</a>.</li> 
</ul> 
<p><strong >For candies and sweets,</strong></p> 
<ul type=disc > 
<li >Try fresh fruit or unsweetened dried fruit.</li> 
</ul> 
<p>Try new things in the kitchen. Get creative, and have fun.</p>
