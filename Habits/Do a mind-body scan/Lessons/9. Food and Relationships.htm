<section id="ember117" >How do your relationships with people affect your relationship with food... and vice versa?</h1>
<p>For better or worse, the way we relate to the people in our lives both mirrors and affects the way we relate to food. Likewise, the way we relate to food can have powerful effects on our relationships with people.</p>
<p>Here's a sobering statistic:</p>
<p><strong >For PN coaching clients, relationships are the number one cause of their troubles with eating.</strong></p>
<p>For females, that statistic applies to 85% of clients.</p>
<p>Not &quot;lack of motivation&quot;. Not &quot;lack of willpower&quot;. Not &quot;laziness&quot;. Not &quot;poor nutritional knowledge or kitchen skills&quot;. Not &quot;gluttony&quot;.</p>
<p><em >Relationships.</em></p>

<section id="ember118" >
<h1 >Food is love... or is it?</h1>
<p>Food is so much more than fuel. We eat for many reasons other than keeping ourselves alive. Some of those reasons are healthy and positive. Some of them are less so.</p>
<p>For instance:</p>
<p><strong >Some of us look for the comfort, soothing, and physical pleasure that we aren't getting from our relationships.</strong></p>
<p>Unlike certain people, food is undemanding. It's always there for us and it lives to give. Overeating is often a welcome release in a life that is full of commitments, obligations, responsibilities, and demands from others.</p>
<p><strong >Some of us try to protect ourselves by eating (or not eating).</strong> Many people can trace their disordered eating to a period of their lives when they were being abused, physically or psychologically. Being overweight can be a way of disguising ourselves and warding off unwanted attention.</p>
<p><strong >Some of us &quot;stuff&quot; ourselves with food to help us &quot;stuff&quot; our emotions.</strong> Eating can distract us from conflict, or take the place of self-assertion and direct confrontation.</p>
<p>The good news:</p>
<p>We can address painful pasts and unmet needs. Habits can be changed.</p>
</section>
<section id="ember119" >
<h1 >Monkey see, monkey do</h1>
<p>Sometimes we fall into unhealthy eating routines by default—by copying what people around us are doing.</p>
</section>
<section id="ember120" >
<p>For example:</p>
<p><strong >The Mismatch</strong><br > You move in with a tall, naturally skinny guy. He works in construction, and you work at a desk all day. You eat what he eats. Years later, he goes to the worksite still wearing his high school jeans, and you're considering going to work in a muumuu.</p>
<p><strong >The Provider</strong><br > You care for your family and want their approval. <em >Food is love</em>, you think. You cook what they enjoy, and indulge in it heartily, as a way of showing affection. Plus, the kids love burger night, right?</p>
<p><strong >The Food Pushers</strong><br > <em >&quot;Oh just have one bite! You're always on some stupid diet!&quot;</em> Whether at a party, an office social, a bar mitzvah, or breaking the Ramadan fast, people sometimes push us to eat more or differently than we would like. Peer pressure can be a powerful force.</p>
<p><strong >The Food Club</strong><br > We all have friendships where bonding happens over a coffee and cake, or a couple of drinks and some nachos. There's nothing wrong with enjoying food and the occasional martini with our friends, but just like the food pushers, it's easy to get roped in to other people's unhealthy habits for social acceptance.</p>
</section>
<section id="ember121" >
<h1 >Try a small relationship adjustment</h1>
<p>It can be overwhelming to try to deal with all relationships at once. If you suspect that your relationships are contributing to disordered eating, start small.</p>
<p><strong >Try concentrating on one relationship.</strong></p>
<p>Maybe that's the one that seems easiest to address, or the one that is most important, or the one that seems to be posing the biggest obstacles to your success.</p>
<p>Thinking about that particular relationship, could you:</p>
<ul type=disc >
<li >Choose a different restaurant for your regular get-togethers (one that offers healthier menu options)?</li>
<li >Suggest meeting for a walk rather than a dessert?</li>
<li >Ask for help?</li>
<li >Do the difficult-difficult work of having a tough conversation instead of stuffing your feelings?</li>
<li >Say no to pressure and food pushers?</li>
<li >Ignore teasing or undermining comments about your weight loss goals, or speak up and tell the person that you find the comments hurtful?</li>
</ul>
<p>Even the easiest-seeming of these suggestions might feel overwhelming at first. Every tiny step you take in the right direction, will eventually accumulate to having profound effects.</p>
