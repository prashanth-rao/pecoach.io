<p>Coach's Notes:&nbsp;Time diary and looking at where one spends one's time; time spent as a reflection of one's true priorities.</p> 
<form > 
<h1 >
<section id="ember122" >Your schedule doesn't lie: Are you spending time on what's truly important?</h1> 
<p>To make a diary, you can use tried and true paper and pen, a spreadsheet, or a time-tracking app like Toggl, or TimeKeeper.</p> 
</section>
<section id="ember123" ><figure > 
<div class='figure'><img src='D:\PE\Procoach\Nutrition\Resource\img\6f12eeb5-cfaf-46a3-88d7-69584b436e1f.jpg' width=100%></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>In 15-minute increments, track how you spent your time today. For example:</p> 
<p><strong >6:30</strong>&nbsp;Woke up<br > <strong >6:45</strong>&nbsp;Shower, get dressed<br > <strong >7:00</strong>&nbsp;Breakfast<br > <strong >7:30</strong>&nbsp;Leave for work<br > <strong >7:30 – 8:45</strong>&nbsp;Commuting<br > <strong >9:00</strong>&nbsp;At work<br > <strong >9:00 – 10:15</strong>&nbsp;Working<br > <strong >10:15</strong>&nbsp;Coffee break</p> 
<p>Etc.</p> 
</section>
<section id="ember125" > 
<h1 >Analyze your diary</h1> 
<p>Once you've finished your time diary, take a look at it. Add up the time spent on various tasks. For example:</p> 
<ul type=disc > 
<li ><strong >9 hours</strong>—at work (total)<br > 4 hours—at work, actually working<br > 2.5 hours—at work, cruising Facebook<br > 30 minutes—at work, hanging out with coworkers talking about last night's reality TV show<br > 2 hours—at work, making doodles in a meeting</li> 
<li ><strong >2.5</strong>&nbsp;hours—commuting</li> 
<li ><strong >1.5</strong>&nbsp;hours—TV</li> 
<li ><strong >1 hour</strong>—workout</li> 
</ul> 
<p>Etc.</p> 
<p>Then, ask yourself:</p> 
<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong >How am I spending my time?</strong><br > Look at the time spent on all tasks.</p> 
<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong >What are my top priorities in life? What is important to me—what brings me joy?</strong><br > If you aren't sure what your life priorities are, this is a good time to think about them.</p> 
<p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong >How much time am I spending on my top life priorities?</strong><br > Does your schedule reflect your values?</p> 
<p>4.&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong >What are my &quot;time-suckers&quot;?</strong><br > Time-suckers are things that take up time, but don't really benefit you. This could be standing in a lineup, watching TV, cruising the internet, being physically at work but not doing anything productive, etc.</p> 
<p>5.&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong >Given this, what could I change about my schedule so that my time reflects my top life priorities?</strong><br > What might you need to change or adjust? How could you do more of what you love in life?</p> 
</section>
<section id="ember126" > 
<h1 >What could you change?</h1> 
<p>Could you…</p> 
<p><strong >Do fewer things, but with more focus?</strong><br > Creating a priority list will help you decide what to do first.</p> 
<p><strong >Cut down one &quot;time sucker&quot;?</strong><br > If necessary, use a timer. Decide in advance that you'll spend 10 minutes creeping your old high school friend's Facebook page, or watching videos of cute baby animals, and no more. When that alarm goes off, you're done. Say goodbye to the party photos and sneezing baby pandas. (Try a browser app like&nbsp;<a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/stayfocusd/laankejkbhbdhmipfmgcngdelahlfoji?hl=en" target="_blank" >StayFocusd</a>&nbsp;if you need extra help.)</p> 
<p><strong >Ask for help?</strong><br > (Yeah, we know, it's hard.)</p> 
<p><strong >Uni-task instead of multi-task?</strong><br > Studies show that contrary to what you might expect, doing&nbsp;<em >one</em>&nbsp;thing at a time, with your full attention, works much better than trying to juggle a bunch of stuff at once.</p>
