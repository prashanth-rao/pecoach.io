<p>As you do mind-body scans over the next few days, what signals is your body giving you about your coping style under stress?</p>
<p>Under stress, do you tend to over-function, or under-function?</p>
<p>Pause to self-reflect, and get insight into some deeper motivations.</p>
<li> <strong >What's good about your stress-coping style?</strong> How does it benefit and serve you? Are you seeing the results of your coping style show up in your body? Where are you seeing positive results?</li>
<li> <strong >What's bad about your stress-coping style?</strong> What does it cost you? How does it cost you in your body and deep health?</li>
<li> <strong >How does your stress-coping style affect your nutrition and exercise practices?</strong> How is stress affecting the choices you make on nutrition and exercise?</li>

<h1 >Pausing to direct towards <em >just a little bit better</em></h1>
<p>When you're able to pause in the moment, gain perspective, and reflect on the bigger picture of a stressful situation, you can think more clearly.</p>
<p>You can use that space to ask grounding questions like:</p>
<li> <strong >Is my body telling me that I'm dealing with this situation in the best possible way?</strong></li>
<li> <strong >Right now, in this situation, how could I respond just a little bit better... so that I stay true to what's important to me, and do what honestly makes my body feel good?</strong></li>
<li> <strong >Knowing what I know thus far about my body and brain, how can I help myself be slightly more awesome... right now?</strong></li>
