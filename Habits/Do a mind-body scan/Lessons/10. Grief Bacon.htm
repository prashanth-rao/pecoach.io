<section id="ember117" >Loss, trauma, and overeating.</h1> 
<p>The Germans have a word for over-eating caused by grief, loss, and emotional distress:&nbsp;<em >Kummerspeck</em>, or &quot;grief fat&quot;, also sometimes translated as &quot;grief bacon&quot;.</p> 
<p>Germans also have&nbsp;<em >Frustfressen</em>, or &quot;frustration eating&quot;.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The&nbsp;<em >concept</em>&nbsp;is kind of funny. The feelings and experiences are real. Loss hurts. Grief hurts. Trauma hurts like hell.</p> 
<p>These things are part of being human. We might grieve when a person or a pet dies, gets sick, or goes away.</p> 
<p>There are also less obvious sources of grief. We might grieve:</p> 
<ul type=disc > 
<li ><strong >the loss of an identity or way of life</strong>—for instance, when we finish a job and retire, or when the kids leave home</li> 
<li ><strong >a financial loss</strong>—for instance, if we can't afford our house, or if we lose our jobs</li> 
<li ><strong >the loss of an idea or expectation</strong>—for instance, &quot;I was supposed to do X with my life&quot; or &quot;All people are trustworthy&quot;</li> 
<li ><strong >the loss of a relationship</strong>—for instance, when we break up with a partner</li> 
</ul> 
<p>We can lose and grieve all kinds of things. All are real to us, and&nbsp;<strong >all feelings of grief and loss are valid</strong>—regardless of whether it's a dead budgie or a major life crisis.</p> 
</section>
<section id="ember120" > 
<h1 >What does grief feel like?</h1> 
<p>Like all emotions, you can feel grief, loss, and trauma in your body.</p> 
<ul type=disc > 
<li >Grief might feel &quot;heavy&quot;. You might feel lethargic and fatigued, or like something is sitting deep in your stomach. You might have unexplained aches and pains.</li> 
<li >Loss might feel like something is missing, or like there's an &quot;emptiness&quot; or &quot;hole&quot; in your middle.</li> 
<li >Trauma might feel like unexpected anxiety or fear. It might feel like a desire to run and hide, or a physical sense of being trapped. You might startle easily—you jump out of your skin when the phone rings.</li> 
</ul> 
<p>Grief, loss, and/or trauma can change the way we feel about food and eating. For instance:</p> 
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You might find that you want to overeat at certain times, like meaningful dates.</p> 
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you've lost something, you might eat because loss feels like &quot;wanting something&quot;. Eating is an attempt to &quot;fill the void&quot;. The Portuguese have a word for this:&nbsp;<em >saudade</em>, which translates roughly as, &quot;a vague and constant desire for something that does not and probably cannot exist&quot;.</p> 
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Many people use food and eating to deal with the anxiety of trauma, as well as the fear of having to deal with the potential trauma again. Deep down, people might feel like staying fat means staying safe—and transforming into a lean, healthy body is scary.</p> 
<p>There's similar patterns with exercise.</p> 
<ul type=disc > 
<li >You might be driven to push harder and harder. The pain of a tough workout (or the endorphins after) temporarily numb the pain of other things.</li> 
<li >You might want to avoid exercise. Maybe you feel ashamed, embarrassed, constantly achey, or just like a slug.</li> 
</ul> 
<p>The important points:</p> 
<p><strong >Painful thoughts and emotions have physical &quot;signatures&quot;.</strong></p> 
<p>Difficult emotions can&nbsp;<em >feel like</em>&nbsp;hunger or emptiness that has to be filled.</p> 
<p>We might use food, eating and/or exercise to deal with and distract ourselves from this pain.</p>

<section id="ember121" > 
<h1 >What to do?</h1> 
<p>If this is something you're dealing with, here are some suggestions.</p> 
<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong >Recognize that emotional pain has physical symptoms.</strong>&nbsp;Grief, loss, and trauma change your body experience, your appetite, and your relationship with food. It's easy to confuse these feelings with hunger.</p> 
<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong >Recognize that what you're dealing with is real to you.</strong>&nbsp;All feelings of grief and loss are valid, whether you're dealing with losing your job, getting divorced, or just the minor traumas of existence.</p> 
<p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong >If you find yourself struggling with eating, do a mind-body scan.</strong>&nbsp;Can you find a pattern between your hunger, food habits, and what's happening in your life?</p> 
<p>4.&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong >Don't try to deal with this alone. Ask for help.</strong></p> 
<p>You're not bad, broken, weak, or crazy. You're normal and human. Ask for help if you need it. The more support you have, the better.</p> 
<p>Your coaching program can take care of the nutrition end of things. If you need additional help in the form of counseling, seek it out.</p>

<h1 >Let go… on purpose</h1> 
<p>Fear of grief and loss also prevents us from letting go. We might think,&nbsp;<em >&quot;I need food X, or behavior Y, because otherwise…&quot;</em></p> 
<p>Over the next few days, practice letting go of something small:</p> 
<ul type=disc > 
<li >a thought</li> 
<li >a self-criticism</li> 
<li >an idea or image of what you &quot;should&quot; be doing</li> 
<li >a familiar daily action</li> 
<li >a thing</li> 
<li >a food item or habit</li> 
<li >a workout habit</li> 
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Use a mind-body scan to observe what happens. Tune in to the negative and positive feelings. Often, once you get over the initial challenge, letting go feels pretty good.</p>
