<section id="ember119" >For all the caregivers: It's time to take care of you.</h1>
<p>It's 7 pm on a weekday evening.</p>
<p>Your youngest is howling because she has an ear infection and a history presentation due tomorrow. You're trying to corral child #2 into taking a bath, but he's more interested in hitting his ear-infected sister.</p>
<p>The phone rings. It's your mom, who's freaking out because your dad with Alzheimer's has gone wandering again.</p>
<p>Your spouse is in bed with the flu and can't lend a hand.</p>
<p>Sigh.</p>
<p>Eating right and exercising may be the furthest thing from your mind right now, unless it involves exercise in the form of running away.</p>

<h1 >Who cares? You.</h1>
<p>If you're a grown adult, chances are good that you're involved in taking care of at least one other person: financially, physically, mentally, or emotionally.</p>
<p>If you're younger, you might have young children. If you're older, you might also have an aging parent. (And some folks are stuck in between!)</p>
<p>Most caregivers also have jobs. This adds to the demands.</p>
<p>Feeling tired yet? How about guilty?</p>
<p>Women, specifically, are twice as likely than men to take time off work to care for aging parents, and to travel long distances to do it. Many women say they feel guilty for not doing enough. The more hours they spend on paid work, the guiltier they feel.</p>
<p>While things are slowly changing, caregiving is still mostly women's work.</p>

<p>The stress affects all, not only women.</p>
<p>In the United States:</p>
<li> 73% of Americans say money is the number-one factor that affects their stress level. Work comes a close second.</li>
<li> Nearly half of Americans say that they are increasingly stressed about their ability to provide for their family's basic needs.</li>
<li> Over half of American men say they are stressed about job stability.</li>

<h1 >Caring is costly</h1>
<p>Caregiving can be very rewarding. It can be a primary sense of worth, make you feel like you're contributing something valuable and meaningful.</p>
<p><strong >Caregiving is important work.</strong></p>
<p>Caregiving can also take a lot of time and energy. It's physically and emotionally stressful. (That's precisely one reason that it feels so rewarding.)</p>
<p>What often gets left out of the caregiving? You.</p>

<h1 >Learn <em >self</em>-care</h1>
<p>If you've flown on an airplane, you know the drill with the oxygen masks: If you're with someone who can't put on their oxygen mask, you put on your mask first.</p>

<p><strong >Being a caregiver without adequately caring for yourself is unsustainable. Eventually you run out of gas, and then you aren't much help at all.</strong></p>
<p>Self-care can be hard to do. Caregivers often don't want to put their needs first. They might have trouble asking for what they want and need, even if it's just an afternoon off or an extra hour of sleep.</p>
<p>If that could be you...</p>
<ul type=disc >
<li ><strong >Do you feel guilty and/or worry</strong> about not being a &quot;perfect&quot; caregiver?</li>
<li ><strong >Do you feel like you have to do everything yourself</strong>—and often feel overwhelmed as a result?</li>
<li ><strong >Do you feel ashamed and/or selfish</strong> about asking for things that you need?</li>
<li ><strong >Do you resent all the things you're doing</strong>... and then feel badly about that?</li>
<li ><strong >Do you cut corners when it comes to your own health</strong>—perhaps neglecting good nutrition, regular activity, and adequate rest? or relying on things like caffeine, stimulants, and other medications?</li>
</ul>
<p><strong >Self-care helps you be a better caregiver.</strong></p>

<h1 >Self-care strategies</h1>
<p>One way to reframe and prevent burnout: Think of daily healthy practices as your &quot;anchors&quot; that let you weather the storms, rather than as &quot;extras&quot; or self-indulgent frills.</p>
<p>More tips on healthy self-care practices:</p>
<ul type=disc >
<li ><strong >Reach out to others.</strong> Don't suffer alone. Caregiving can be isolating.</li>
<li ><strong >Get help.</strong> Even assistance with a few little things can make a big difference.</li>
<li ><strong >If possible, look at how work is allocated in your household, and try to re-organize it a little.</strong> Are you trying to do everything yourself, even if you don't need to? Can other household members take on a task or two?</li>
<li ><strong >Don't try to be &quot;perfect&quot; — &quot;good enough&quot; will often do fine.</strong> Take one extra job off your plate. Say &quot;no&quot; where appropriate.</li>
<li ><strong >Planning and preparation help a lot.</strong> For instance, the Sunday Ritual of meal prep can make the rest of the week a lot easier to manage.</li>
<li ><strong >Use your active recovery and days off as an opportunity to treat yourself to a little something extra.</strong> Why not an extra bit of sleep or a massage? <em >Exercise is a great stress reliever and re-energizer.</em> Even if you can't do a full workout, try getting out for a quick walk.</li>
