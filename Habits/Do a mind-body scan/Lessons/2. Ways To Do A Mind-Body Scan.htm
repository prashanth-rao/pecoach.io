<p>Before each meal, take 30-60 seconds to do a quick &quot;mind-body scan&quot;.</p>
<p>During the meal, pause now and again to do the scan again. Put your fork down and take a moment to check in.</p>
<ul type=disc >
<li >What do you feel right now, really?</li>
<li >How is that separate from a narration?</li>
<li >Is what you're feeling different from what you're telling yourself you feel?</li>
</ul>
<p>For now, try to notice and name whatever you feel, and don't worry about what to do with those feelings or try to change them.</p>
<p>Some questions you could ask yourself are:</p>
<ul type=disc >
<li ><em >If I feel any anxiety or stress, how does that show up in my body and movement? For instance, am I fidgeting? Furrowing my brow? Etc.</em></li>
<li ><em >If I feel happiness or joy, where do I feel it in my body?</em></li>
<li ><em >If I feel energetic, where do I feel it in my body?</em></li>
<li ><em >If I feel hungry (or full), where do I feel it in my body?</em></li>
</ul>
<p>And listen.</p>
<p>If you visit your doctor or the hospital, you might notice that they'll scribble notes about symptoms on a body diagram like this, to show the exact location of particular things.</p>
