<h1 align=center >Bodies Speak</h1>
<h2 align=center >This week, we dig a little deeper into the issues that may drive your food habits.</h2>
<form >
<h1 >
<section id="ember110" >Bodies don't speak in words. They do speak in other ways.</h1>
<p>Bodies speak in signals like:</p>
<ul type=disc >
<li >Pain</li>
<li >Inflammation</li>
<li >Chronic illness</li>
<li >Addiction</li>
<li >Energy levels and fatigue</li>
</ul>
<p>If we're not paying attention to those signals, and addressing the root problems of the symptoms and behaviors, the body will start to speak even louder. And it will continue to ask for what it wants.</p>
<p><strong >One of the loudest ways the body speaks is by eating.</strong></p>
<p>Eating can be a language that the body uses to express its distress about something that's going unaddressed.</p>
<p>It's common for eating to be used as a coping behavior for stress. In those times, eating is an expression of an emotional feeling in the body other than physiological hunger.</p>
<p>If your eating behavior is highly emotionally charged—if you eat too much or too little, repeatedly eat trigger foods, or obsess about eating—your body is speaking, giving you clues.</p>
<p>Food and eating issues are a normal bodily response to a distressing situation.</p>
<p><strong >It makes sense. Eating is calming.</strong></p>
<p>Eating can be calming because it narrows your focus of attention.</p>
<p>When it's just us and the food, the rest of the world disappears.</p>
<p>We don't have to think unpleasant or stressful thoughts, or have difficult conversations or social interactions, or feel painful feelings. The rest of the universe falls away.</p>
<p>Eating can act like a drug in our brains that focuses attention.</p>
<p>Some folks say it's like looking at the food through a tunnel. And that delicious light at the end of the tunnel is a release—comfort, security, escape. Like alcohol, eating brings us down to an immediate, moment-by-moment experience.</p>
<p>Or maybe restricting food and trying to be in control (for example, by trying a new diet plan, or rigidly deeming foods &quot;bad&quot; and &quot;good&quot;) makes us feel like maybe we could also control our uncontrollable lives too.</p>
<p><strong >Many people who struggle with maintaining healthy eating also see unwanted behaviors in other areas.</strong></p>
<p>For example, unwanted behaviors like:</p>
<ul type=disc >
<li >over-exercising</li>
<li >retreating into lethargy</li>
<li >drinking alcohol excessively</li>
<li >excessive smoking</li>
<li >depression or anxiety</li>
<li >working too much</li>
<li >turbulent relationships</li>
</ul>
<p>That kind of &quot;mixed bag&quot; makes dealing with food and eating particularly tough.</p>

<section id="ember111" >
<h1 >The root of coping behaviors</h1>
<p>Researchers have found that people who struggle with a healthy relationship with eating (and other things, like over-exercising or other addictions) generally have one or more of the following challenges elsewhere in their lives:</p>
<p>1. <strong >Grief and loss.</strong> This can be loss of a person or pet, but also of an idea, an identity, or a way of life (for example, if you've lost your job, or had some of your life illusions shattered). It can also include trauma.</p>
<p>2. <strong >Life change.</strong> Maybe you've just had a baby, taken on a new job, moved, or recently become divorced. Your identity and life circumstances have shifted.</p>
<p>3. <strong >Relationship problems</strong>, whether that's relationships with partners, family members, friends, or coworkers.</p>
<p>4. <strong >Intrapersonal deficits</strong>, which is a fancy way of saying not having the skills or expertise to deal with the stuff that life is handing you. Maybe you find it tough to express your feelings and thoughts. You might feel like you're often misunderstood or alone. Perhaps you struggle to connect meaningfully with other people. Or maybe you're just in a new, unfamiliar situation (such as a country where you don't speak the language, or starting school).</p>

<section id="ember112" >
<h1 >A mind-body scan opportunity</h1>
<p>As you think about your relationship to eating, and how it could be more complex than is obvious, think of it in terms of a mind-body scan.</p>
<p><strong >What do you feel in your body when you think about these things?</strong> What clues does that give you about where your issues lie?</p>
