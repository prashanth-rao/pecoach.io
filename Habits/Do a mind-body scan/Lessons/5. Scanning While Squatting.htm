<p><strong >Practice more mindful training</strong></p> 
<p>The next time you're at the gym, remember to pause. Take a few moments, stare off into space like you're having a deep thought, and do a quick mind-body scan.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Scan your physical sensations, emotions, and thoughts quickly, head to toe, noticing and naming what you're experiencing.</p> 
<p>You can nudge it into natural transition times:</p> 
<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp; Just before your workout.</p> 
<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp; During a set of weights. (Don't drop anything!)</p> 
<p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp; Between weight sets.</p> 
<p>4.&nbsp;&nbsp; Right after your workout.</p> 
<p>Scan for the three primary categories of body signals:</p> 
<ul type=disc > 
<li ><strong >Thought signals</strong>.<br > How were your thoughts about training before, during, and after the workout. Did they change? If so, how?</li> 
<li ><strong >Emotional signals</strong>.<br > How were your emotions before, during, and after. Did they change? If so, how?</li> 
<li ><strong >Physical signals</strong>.<br > How were your physical sensations before, during, and after. Did they change? If so, how?</li> 
</ul>

<section id="ember115" > 
<h1 >Some questions to ask yourself</h1> 
<p>Do you notice any points of tightness or restriction in your body? Any parts that felt especially strong or mobile?</p> 
<p>What do you feel as you do a particular exercise? Are you recruiting the right muscles? Can you perceive what your body is doing?</p> 
<p>Can you make small physical adjustments, if necessary? Reading your body cues, could you improve your exercise form?</p> 
<p>Do you notice any thoughts you had, or assumptions, about the workout? How did those thoughts and assumptions evolve during the workout?</p> 
<p>Did anything surprise you? Did anything change?</p> 
<p>What feels good about this workout? (Pause to kiss your mighty biceps, as needed.)</p>
