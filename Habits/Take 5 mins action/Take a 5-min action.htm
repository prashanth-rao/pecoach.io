<section id="ember97" >Practice taking a 5-min action every day.</h1> 
<p>In coaching as in life, you're the expert of your experience.</p> 
<p>Better than anyone else, you know your body. You know your lifestyle, abilities, wants and needs. You know your goals.</p> 
<p>Based on what you already know about yourself, tap in to your own expertise.</p> 
<p><strong >How is your daily practice going?</strong></p> 
<p>Below is a reminder of what to do.</p> 
</section>
<section id="ember99" > 
<p><strong >Starting today,</strong></p> 
<p>1. <strong >Pick </strong><em ><b>one</b></em><strong> improvement you want to make.</strong><br > There are endless changes to be made to move you towards your goals. Try choosing just one.</p> 
<p>2. <strong >Break that one improvement down into a very, very, very small and simple chunk.</strong> A chunk you can do in 5–10 minutes, today. If it's helpful, you can use the 4-circle diagram below to break-down your larger goal into a practical 5-minute action. The &quot;Today&quot; circle holds the 5-min action.</p> 
<p>3. <strong >Commit to practicing one 5-minute action every day.</strong> That can be the same 5-minute action that builds, or it can be something different every day. You decide what works best for your life and your goals. Collaborate with your coach to set a plan that's right for you. Then, assess the progress. Take what you've learned to adjust course and find the fastest, easiest track towards your goals.</p> 
<p><strong >As always (most importantly): learn about yourself.</strong></p> 
<li> <strong >What do you like and what do you need?</strong><br > Keep paying attention to how you think, feel and act. What patterns do you notice when you make these changes? </li>
<p>Use this as an experiment to build your Owner’s Manual.</p>

<h1 >Ideas for action</h1> 
<p>Here are some ideas to get started:</p> 
<li> Book a time or place to get your workout done. </li>
<li> Take 5-min to book an appointment you've been putting off. </li>
<li> Take the stairs rather than the elevator in your daily routine. </li>
<li> Park 5-min farther away from the door to your office building. </li>
<li> Practice a new cooking skill. </li>
<li> Start a gratitude journal. </li>
<li> Take a multivitamin. </li>
<li> If you’re recovering from an injury or illness, practice your rehab exercises. </li>
<li> Add 5 minutes of mobility and stretching to the beginning or end of your workout. </li>
<li> If you’re typically indoors, find fresh air and sunlight in the middle of the day. </li>
<p>Ask yourself:</p> 
<p><strong >What’s </strong><em ><b>one small</b></em><strong> action I can take today that would make me feel just a little more awesome?</strong></p> 
</section>
<section id="ember105" > 
<h1 >Start small, experiment, and collaborate</h1> 
<p>Make it easy. Choose &quot;low-hanging fruit&quot;. Small, simple, practical, and almost guaranteed to succeed.</p> 
<p>Don't start a big project or get over-ambitious. Don't over-think it.</p> 
<p><strong >Aim for 100% confident that you can do each day's task.</strong></p> 
<p>The goal of this practice is:</p> 
<p>1. Visualize a larger goal</p> 
<p>2. Break that goal down into related simple, practical actions that move you forward</p> 
<p>3. Take action every day towards the future you want for yourself</p> 
<p>One small step at a time.</p> 
<p>What can you learn about yourself and what you want? What’s uncomfortable? What trade-offs are you willing to make, and not make?</p> 
<p>Experiment. Keep it simple, fun, creative and practical.</p> 
<p><strong >Collaborate with your coach to find the plan that’s best for you.</strong></p>
