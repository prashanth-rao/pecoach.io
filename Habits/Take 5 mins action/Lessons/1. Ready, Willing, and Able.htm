<p>1. How <strong >ready</strong> are you to change?</p>
<p>2. How <strong >willing</strong> are you to change?</p>
<p>3. How <strong >able</strong> are you to change?</p>

<section id="ember554" >
<h1 >How ready are you to change?</h1>
<p><strong >How ready are you to change your existing nutrition, health, and fitness practices?</strong></p>
<p>What brought you to this program?</p>
<p>Are you sick of the status quo? Or do you feel that your old routines are still working pretty well for you?</p>
<p>Score yourself. On a scale of 1 to 10, with 1 being “Too soon! Not ready.” and 10 being “Totally ready! Bring it.”</p>

<section id="ember556" >
<h1 >How willing are you to change?</h1>
<p><strong >How willing are you to trust the coaching process and let change happen, or purposely challenge some of your existing ways of doing things?</strong></p>
<p>How open are you right now to changing your mindset, habits, and routines?</p>
<p>Are you willing to flow with the coaching process? Or do you hate being told what to do?</p>
<p>Score yourself. On a scale of 1 to 10, with 1 being “No change! I’m digging my heels in.” and 10 being “Change me! I’m putty in your hands.”</p>

<section id="ember558" >
<h1 >How able are you to change?</h1>
<p><strong >How able are you to change right now?</strong></p>
<p>Despite any amount of personal readiness and willingness, there could be real external barriers blocking progress.</p>
<p>For example, a tough work schedule, having a new baby, or an unsupportive home or work environment.</p>
<p>Score yourself. On a scale of 1 to 10, with 1 being “Right now, I simply can’t change.” and 10 being “I have all the tools and support I need.”</p>
