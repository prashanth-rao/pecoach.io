<p>Outdoor survival tip...</p>
<p>When you're running from a bear, you don't have to run the <em >fastest</em>.</p>
<p><strong >All you have to do is run a little bit faster than the slowest person.</strong></p>
<p>If health were like running from a bear, when you're improving your choices, you never have to be &quot;perfect&quot;.</p>
<p>You only have to be <em >a little bit better</em>, consistently.</p>

<h1 >The 0% Game</h1>
<p>There are some parents who focus on how much less than 100% their kids got.</p>
<p>As in, &quot;If you get 90% on your math test, what happened to the other 10%?&quot;</p>
<p>Starting from 100% (i.e., perfect) and working backwards means that whatever you have is inadequate, and below expectations. The glass is half-empty.</p>
<p>Looking at the same situation from reverse, gives a much brighter picture.</p>
<p>The reverse is:</p>
<p><strong >1) Start from 0%.</strong></p>
<p><strong >2) Then </strong><em ><b>add</b></em><strong>.</strong></p>
<p>For example:</p>
<li> What is 0% fitness? Well, maybe lying in a full body cast in a hospital bed on a ventilator for a year.</li>
<li> What is 0% nutrition? Maybe eating things that aren't food. Like old newspapers, Vaseline, or cotton balls. Or rat poison.</li>
<li> What is 0% health? Dead.</li>
<p>How could you apply that frame to your coaching experience?</p>
<li> If 0% fitness is the body cast... what's your current fitness level?</li>
<li> If 0% exercise is lying in bed immobilized... how much better are your exercise habits?</li>
<li> If 0% nutrition is eating bits of string, dust bunnies, or antifreeze... how much better are your nutrition habits?</li>
<li> If 0% health is dead, then even if you've got raging stomach flu today, you've gotta be at least 50% healthy.</li>
<p>Does your situation look bright when you reframe, when you start from the worse case scenario?</p>
<p>The final step is:</p>
<p><strong >3) What would make you one step better today?</strong></p>
<p>What practice would move you <em >just a little bit</em> forward today, to make you just a little bit better today?</p>

<h1 >Progress, not perfection</h1>
<p>Consider two options.</p>
<p>Option 1: Making yourself crazy for a week chasing a &quot;100%&quot; performance, then burning out and giving up.</p>
<p>Option 2: Trying to be 1% better every day, for a full year of coaching.</p>
<p>The math.</p>
<p>7 days x 100% effort + 358 days x 0% effort = no change, or backsliding. You end up feeling like a failure.</p>
<p>365 days x 1% better every day = significant transformation. You end up feeling like a superstar.</p>
<p><strong >Focus on &quot;making a little progress&quot; each day rather than being &quot;perfect&quot;.</strong></p>
<p>Start from 0% and add. Notice small accomplishments. Let yourself be &quot;good enough for now&quot;. Take undue pressure off. Be patient.</p>
<p>Keep showing up. Keep trying.</p>
<p>And let the bear bite someone else in the butt.</p>
</section>
<section id="ember98" >
<h1 >Start now</h1>
<p><strong >Don't wait for the &quot;perfect&quot; day, &quot;perfect&quot; body, or &quot;perfect&quot; schedule full of free time to come.</strong></p>
<p><strong >It never will.</strong></p>
<p>Do something now. Take a 5-minute action doing whatever you can do, immediately, to stay on track.</p>
<p>Do that, and you're already 1% better.</p>
</section>
<section id="ember100" >
<h1 >Keep it real</h1>
<p>Start wherever you are.</p>
<p>Use whatever you have.</p>
<p>Do whatever you can.</p>
