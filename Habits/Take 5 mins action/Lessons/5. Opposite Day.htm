<h1 >Opposite Day</h1> 
<h2 >Are those ingrained and familiar habits really working for you? Test it. Try the opposite.</h2> 
<form > 
<h1 >
<section id="ember753" >Today try something completely different</h1> 
<p>If you're like most people, you've tried to get in shape and/or lose weight before.</p> 
<p>You may have established certain &quot;rules&quot; about how it works.</p> 
<p>In some extreme examples, getting healthy or fit might involve...</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Detox diet? Bring on the green juice.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; $500 spent at Nike on sweat pants and workout gear? The credit card is still smoking.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Elaborate workouts with weird exercises and complex set and rep equations? Yep.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hours of hamstering on a treadmill? Drive belt is greased and ready.</p> 
<p>And the best part? Cramming all the dieting and workout extremes into one day.</p> 
<p>If those are the plans, it's no wonder that so many people find it hard to get in shape. If the strategy is&nbsp;<em >everything all at once</em>, and&nbsp;<em >too much too soon</em>, failure is easy.</p> 
<p>Fortunately, science knows that's not how bodies work. That's not how&nbsp;<em >you</em>&nbsp;work.</p> 
<p>Science knows there are better ways. Research and experience show that to make dramatic and lasting change, you need to simplify. That means,</p> 
<p><strong >Master one basic practice at a time.</strong></p> 
<p>If that plan sounds new to you, try it. Test it with an opposite day.</p>

<h1 >The Opposite Test</h1> 
<p>It's like that episode of Seinfeld. George decides to do the opposite of everything he usually does, because his life sucks. When he follows the opposites, his luck changes and everything begins to go his way.</p> 
<p>Can you use the same formula for changing your nutrition (and lifestyle) practices?</p> 
<p>For example, wouldn't it be nice to:</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Be free of obsessive calorie counting?</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Be able to work out anywhere, any time, doing something you actually enjoy?</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Get enough quality sleep and relaxation, to feel calm and content?</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Keep your exercise and eating simple?</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Make measurable progress?</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Take things one easy step at a time?</p> 
<p><strong >Try an Opposite Day...</strong></p> 
<p>Make a list of everything you've previously tried to lose weight and/or get in shape. Assess how those things have&nbsp;<em >really</em>&nbsp;been working for you, and consider how doing the opposite might look instead.</p>

<section id="ember757" > 
<h1 >How's that working for you?</h1> 
<p>&quot;How's that working for you?&quot; is a quick self-assessment of the choices you've been making in nutrition, movement, and lifestyle. It's a way to&nbsp;<strong >look at your experience as evidence</strong>.</p> 
<p>For instance:</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Did extreme diet rules really get you lasting results... or did they set off a rebound binge that erased any gains?</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Did restrictive dieting really work with your whole life... or were you making trade-offs that were going unnoticed?</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Did expensive running shoes really inspire you to get moving... or gather dust in the closet?</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Did that crazy-intense workout plan really turn you into a ninja... or did the dream die by Jan 3rd?</p> 
<p>This questioning process is called&nbsp;<strong >outcome-based decision making</strong>: you assess and decide what to do based on the&nbsp;<em >results</em>&nbsp;those actions will get you.</p> 
</section>
<section id="ember759" > 
<h1 >Are your choices giving you the results you want?</h1> 
<p>Really?</p> 
<p>How did your previous program work out for you?</p> 
<p>If it didn't, it may be time to try some opposites.</p>
