<p>It's a &quot;whole-person, whole-life&quot; view of health involving six main domains.</p>

<p>While deep health is organized into those six categories, the domains aren't actually separate. They're entwined and strongly connected, sometimes even hard to distinguish completely.</p> 
<p><strong >Maintaining a personal minimum of deep health is central to being able to grow, adapt, evolve, and excel as human beings.</strong></p> 
<p>Caring for deep health gives a sense of living in a &quot;life-forward direction&quot;, having vitality and purpose in the world.</p> 
</section>
<section id="ember103" > 
<h1 >What makes deep health different?</h1> 
<p>Caring for deep health means we have a&nbsp;<em >sustainable</em>&nbsp;plan for long-term health and body change. It's a different approach than a short-term diet or precise meal plan (although, those things can also fit nicely within a full life balanced of deep health, too).</p> 
<p>The difference of deep health is an&nbsp;<em >enduring</em>&nbsp;&quot;life-forward direction&quot;, rather than more erratic cycles of spikes and dives.</p> 
<p>Without solid foundations like deep health, conventional health and dieting will take you through fast or repeated cycles of &quot;on&quot; and &quot;off&quot;.</p> 
<p><strong >Being tuned and competent in&nbsp;</strong><em ><b>all</b></em><strong>&nbsp;of&nbsp;</strong><em ><b>your</b></em><strong>&nbsp;levers, builds confidence in a stronger sense of &quot;always on&quot;.</strong></p> 
<p>Watching out for deep health means having a broader awareness of all the levers that support your whole sense of integrated health. It means tuning in to the next likely weakest link, even when that comes from an unlikely place.</p> 
<p>For example, when weight loss stalls because of mental and emotional anxiety during the day, or from skipping recovery and quality family time in the evening.</p> 
<p><strong >Likewise,&nbsp;</strong><em ><b>improving</b></em><strong>&nbsp;one domain can also improve others. Pull a lever in one domain of deep health, and gears in other domains will move.</strong></p> 
<p><strong >Every domain of deep health influences eating and exercise behaviors.</strong></p> 
<p>For sure, regardless of how pro-level your health skills are, there will be ups and downs over a lifetime. Deep health is building a solid foundation, that prevents extreme lows and makes sustained progress easier.</p>

<section id="ember105" > 
<h1 >It's balance, joy, and purpose done&nbsp;<em >consistently</em>.</h1> 
<p>Deep health doesn't come from a pill or an operation.</p> 
<p>It comes from a balanced diet of fresh, whole foods. It comes from enough exercise combined with genuine rest, from clean air and clean water, from real human connection and sincere emotional expression.</p> 
<p>It comes from living with purpose and joy and using your life as an expression of that.</p>

<h1 >How's your deep health?</h1> 
<p><strong >How well are you doing with each domain?</strong></p> 
<p>Download this questionnaire to figure it out.</p> 
</section>
<section id="ember109" > 
<p>For each domain of deep health, you can give yourself a score from 1 (poor) to 10 (awesome).</p> 
<p>In the graphic below, you can put a dot along each spoke that reflects where you are on that spoke, and then draw a line to connect the dots.</p>

<h1 >Choose your strategy</h1> 
<p>The polygon you get can help show you where to focus. You can either: improve the weak points, or make the strong points even stronger.</p> 
<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong >Pick one area to focus on.</strong><br > Rather than addressing all the areas at once, choose one area to focus on for a short time.</p> 
<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong >Pick one small task (within that area) to do right now.</strong>&nbsp;Try practicing that daily for the next two weeks.</p> 
<p>Over time, you can track progress by the way your polygon shape changes.</p> 
<p>Then, reassess and repeat.</p>

<p><em >The goal is to keep the goal the goal.</em><i>&nbsp;—&nbsp;<em >Strength coach Dan John</em></i></p> 
<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong >Focus on behavior, not outcomes.</strong><br > You can only control what you choose to do, rather than the specific outcome. Focus on your actions.</p> 
<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong >Keep the goal the goal.</strong><br > Resist the temptation to jump ship. You may want to waffle. Steer dynamically.</p> 
<p>After careful consideration, if you truly need to adjust the task, do so. Then, full steam ahead.</p>
