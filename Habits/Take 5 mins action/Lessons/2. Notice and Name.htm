<p><i>You can observe a lot by just watching. – Yogi Berra</i></p>
<p>&quot;Noticing and naming&quot; is one way to pay close attention to what's happening.</p>
<p>It means tuning-in to the direct experience of:</p>
<li> Physical sensations,</li>
<li> Thought sensations, and</li>
<li> Emotional sensations.</li>
<p>Practicing noticing and naming can be especially helpful through times of change and feeling resistance.</p>

<section id="ember602" >
<h1 >When thoughts and emotions are especially powerful.</h1>
<p>When you're actively making change, and daily routines are shifting, thoughts and emotions are especially powerful. Internal stories can hold on to old habits and compete against changing. Noticing resistant thought patterns is the first step to changing them.</p>
<p>For example, if you start a practice of eating slowly at every meal, you might think,</p>
<li> I'm too busy for that.</li>
<li> It's weird. Other people will think it's weird.</li>
<li> That's a stupid idea and won't work.</li>
<p>That's resistance pushing back against change. Call it out. Don't worry about &quot;fixing&quot; it, necessarily. After you notice it, then, over time, you can decide whether it stays or goes.</p>
