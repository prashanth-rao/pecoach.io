<h1 >The Costs of Getting Lean</h1>
<h2 >What are you prepared to trade off to get leaner, fitter, and healthier?</h2>

<section id="ember89" >Improving your nutrition, fitness, health (and life) — is about trade-offs.</h1>
<p>In order to say &quot;yes&quot; to something, you have to say &quot;no&quot; to something else. And vice versa.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<li> Saying &quot;yes&quot; to an extra 30 minutes of sleep might mean saying &quot;no&quot; to a half-hour of late-night television.</li>
<li> Saying &quot;yes&quot; to a daily exercise session might mean saying &quot;no&quot; to an hour of Facebook.</li>
<li> Saying &quot;yes&quot; to some of the specific nutrition practices might mean saying “no” to following some other &quot;diet guru&quot; advice.</li>
<li> Saying &quot;yes&quot; to &quot;one day at a time&quot; might mean saying no to &quot;wondering and worrying&quot; about the future.</li>

<h1 >What are you willing to trade?</h1>
<p>You have limited time, resources, and concentration.</p>
<p><strong >What are you prepared to trade off to get leaner, fitter, and/or healthier?</strong></p>
<p>Right now:</p>
<li> What are you prepared to say &quot;yes&quot; to?</li>
<li> What are you prepared to say &quot;no&quot; to?</li>
<li> Out of all the things you want to accomplish, which do you want to do first?</li>
<li> What will you have to stop doing in order to start engaging with coaching wholeheartedly?</li>
<p><strong >There are no right or wrong answers. Just choices and compromises.</strong></p>
<p>It's your call. <em >You</em> decide.</p>
