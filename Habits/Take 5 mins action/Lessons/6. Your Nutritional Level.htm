<p><strong >Start making coaching your game.</strong></p> 
<p>When it comes to nutrition, exercise, and healthy choices,</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong >What are your goals?</strong>&nbsp;What do you want to do?</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong >What do you know?</strong>&nbsp;How much nutritional knowledge do you have?</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong >What skills do you have?</strong>&nbsp;How much change are you able to process and execute?</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong >How consistent are you?</strong>&nbsp;What can you do repeatedly and well?</p> 
<p>To assess those questions, look at the real data you have.</p> 
<p>What evidence does&nbsp;<em >your body</em>&nbsp;show about your choices? For example, are you lean, strong, healthy and mobile? Do you feel good and full of energy?</p> 
<p>These questions and the evidence from your body and lifestyle will help you identify your nutritional level. The bottom line to assessing nutritional level is assessing&nbsp;<em >consistent, quality action</em>.</p> 
<p>Take a moment and think about how those questions apply to you. As always with self-assessments, there's no wrong or right answers, other than what's true for you.</p> 
<p><strong >Why is this important?</strong></p> 
<p>Knowing your nutritional level will help you,</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; understand what goals are important to you, and what isn't</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; set realistic expectations for change, and match behaviors to those expectations</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; determine the smartest next steps for you and why</p> 
<p>Different nutritional goals, and different starting points, require different tasks, effort, skill, and diligence.</p> 
<p>The table below outlines some of the major differences between nutritional levels.</p> 
<p>It's important how these levels are related. Level 1 holds all the foundational practices of quality, consistent nutrition. Level 1 is where most people are and where most change is made. Level 2 and 3 are both always optional stages to consider.</p> 
<p><strong >For a long, healthy, and rewarding life, you never have to advance beyond Level 1.</strong></p> 
<p>(unlike in video games).</p>

<section id="ember802" > 
<p><strong >Level 1</strong></p> 
<p>At Level 1, body change goals are more broad, and balanced with a range of other lifestyle responsibilities and demands. You're trying to generally improve in life. You may want to lose weight and get in better shape in order to perform better at work, have a more active social life, or feel more positive and engaged throughout the day.</p> 
<p>Level 1 is about following the minimum amount of rules necessary in order to get the body and lifestyle goals you want. Here, practices are simple, focusing on the big picture and essential behaviors, rather than precision in details.</p> 
<p>In Level 1, you can make amazing changes by consistently doing very simple and incremental practices. Mastering Level 1 means mastering the basics regularly and consistently.</p> 
<p>Everyone starts at Level 1. Most stick with mastering Level 1 nutritional strategies for life.</p> 
<p><strong >Level 2</strong></p> 
<p>At Level 2, you're a dedicated recreational exerciser or high-performance athlete. Your diet and exercise habits are consistently solid, and your body and lifestyle choices show it. You maintain fitness, feel good, and perform well. And, those consistent daily practices feel relatively seamless and easy to you.</p> 
<p>After some mastery of the basics, Level 2 clients focus more on expanding their range of choices and skills, like more detailed and varied food prep, nutrient timing, or maintaining goals under very stressful situations (e.g., traveling).</p> 
<p>In Level 2, goals on body change are starting to look more narrow and refined, rather than broad and general. Level 2 clients are starting to narrow their focus on fewer other competing responsibilities and demands that pull attention away from those body change goals.</p> 
<p><strong >Level 3</strong></p> 
<p>Level 3 clients are professional performance or physique athletes. They're nutrition and exercise ninjas that make their living from exercising and eating a certain way. They need detailed custom programs and diets because their job depends on it.</p> 
<p>Because Level 3 practices are extreme and dramatic, they're unsustainable over a long-term (for instance, extreme weight loss, cutting weight for a professional boxing match). These athletes don't and can't perform at Level 3 for more than a few weeks.</p> 
<p><strong >The bottom line to self-assessments</strong></p> 
<p>Identifying your nutritional level helps highlight important information for yourself.</p> 
<p>Work with the level you're at, keep it as simple as possible. Take it one day at a time. No rush.</p> 
<p>Even experienced pros have to practice the basics. &quot;One foot in front of the other&quot; applies to everyone, for building a strong foundation, step by step.</p> 
<p>If it뭩 what's best for you, let yourself be a beginner again.</p>
