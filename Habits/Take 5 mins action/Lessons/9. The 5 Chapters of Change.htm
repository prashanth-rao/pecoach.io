<h1 >Autobiography in Five Short Chapters</h1>
<p>– <em>Portia Nelson</em></p>
<p><strong>Chapter 1</strong><br> I walk down the street.<br> There is a deep hole in the sidewalk.<br> I fall in.<br> I am lost. I am helpless.<br> It isn't my fault. It takes forever to find a way out.</p>
<p><strong>Chapter 2</strong><br> I walk down the street.<br> There is a deep hole in the sidewalk.<br> I pretend that I don't see it.<br> I fall in again.<br> I can't believe I am in this same place.<br> But it isn't my fault.<br> It still takes a long time to get out.</p>
<p><strong>Chapter 3</strong><br> I walk down the same street.<br> There is a deep hole in the sidewalk.<br> I see it is there.<br> I still fall in. It's a habit. But my eyes are open.<br> I know where I am.<br> It is my fault.<br> I get out immediately.</p>
<p><strong>Chapter 4</strong><br> I walk down the same street.<br> There is a deep hole in the sidewalk.<br> I walk around it.</p>
<p><strong>Chapter 5</strong><br> I walk down another street.</p>
