<p>Dig down for a second.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What's most important to you in life? Why?</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What kind of person do you want to be? Why?</p> 
<p>Are you living those values?</p> 
<p>Every day?</p> 
<p>Deep health is a matter of meeting your expectations in all dimensions of health: physical, mental, emotional, relational, environmental, and existential.</p> 
<p>View the diagram below for a description of each of these.</p>

<p>The Dimensions of Deep Health</p> 
<p><a href="https://es-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/0e48cdcf-3e27-44dc-ab64-f5ca792116e6.pdf" target="es_attachment" data-test-selector=attached-file-link >PDF</a></p>

<p>Being out of sync with your values in any of those dimensions will impact feeling healthy and living your best life.</p> 
<p>The connection between the brain (psychology) and body (physiology) is important. The brain&nbsp;<em >is</em>&nbsp;the body.</p> 
<p>Knowing&nbsp;<em >what's important to us and why</em>&nbsp;gives humans direction and purpose. How well you're aligned to a psychological set of values will show up biologically in body health. The reverse is also true, that biological health deeply affects psychological health.</p> 
<p><strong >Strong values are powerful.</strong></p> 
<p><strong >Living according to strong values can make life and good health flow, seemingly effortlessly.</strong></p>

<h1 >Do your actions match your values?</h1> 
<p>The 5 Whys exercise aims to cut to the core motivations: the deepest reasons for why you want what you want.</p> 
<p>For example,</p> 
<p><em >&quot;I want to lose weight.&quot;</em></p> 
<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong >Why do I want to lose weight?</strong><br > Because I want to fit into a smaller size of pants.</p> 
<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong >But why do I want to fit into a smaller size of pants?</strong><br > Because when I'm wearing smaller pants, I think I'll look better.</p> 
<p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong >But why do I want to look better?</strong><br > Because when I look good, I feel good about myself.</p> 
<p>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong >But why do I want to feel good about myself?</strong><br > Because when I feel good about myself, I'm more assertive and confident.</p> 
<p>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong >But why do I want to be more assertive and confident?</strong><br > Because when I'm more assertive and confident, I'm in control and better able to get what I want out of life.</p> 
<p>That's a lot of insight for a few little questions.</p> 
<p>For this client, losing fat really meant being in charge of life.</p> 
<p>That's a crucial insight.</p> 
<p>They're not just looking for a smaller pair of pants (or a lower weight on the scale).</p> 
<p>They also wants to feel a certain way at the end of the process. More confident. More assertive. More in control.</p> 
<p>That's what's fundamentally important to them, and that's what the most enduring motivation will be, through the most difficult obstacles and resistance.</p> 
<p>Pant sizes and weight loss can still be an important piece. They're a way to measure a journey towards confidence and a sense of control.</p>

<h1 >Why are you getting nutrition coaching?</h1> 
<p>Deeply. Give it some thought. Be honest.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What really matters to you? What makes you tick?</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the end of this year, what kind of person do you want to be?</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What do you want to feel?</p>
