<section id="ember700" >What do you want?</h1>
<p>A change process often starts with thinking about what we don't want. For instance:</p>
<li> I <em >don't</em> want to be carrying excess body fat.</li>
<li> I <em >don't</em> want to feel out of shape.</li>
<li> I <em >don't</em> want to take all these medications.</li>
<li> I <em >don't</em> want to feel like a foreigner in the gym.</li>
<li> I <em >don't</em> want all these injuries.</li>
<li> I <em >don't</em> want to feel unattractive and unsexy.</li>
<li> I <em >don't</em> want to feel out of control of my eating.</li>
<p>That's a good start. AND, it's not totally clear yet what the destination is. Defining what you want goes deeper than thinking about avoiding what you don't want.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<li> I <strong >want</strong> to be lean and healthy, with some dense bones and strong muscle.</li>
<li> I <strong >want</strong> to be in better shape — strong, fast, flexible, agile, physically capable.</li>
<li> I <strong >want</strong> to take fewer medications, or get off my medications entirely.</li>
<li> I <strong >want</strong> to feel comfortable and confident moving and being active.</li>
<li> I <strong >want</strong> to feel healthy, mobile, functional, and pain-free. I want to thrive, feeling deeply healthy.</li>
<li> I <strong >want</strong> to feel like a stone cold fox.</li>
<li> I <strong >want</strong> to eat normally, intuitively, and sanely. I want to nourish my body with wise food choices.</li>
<p>That feels way more inspiring.</p>
<p>Those visions also start to give a much clearer blueprint for taking action.</p>

<h1 >Today, come up with your Destination Postcard.</h1>
<p>Imagine you could get a postcard from the future that shows exactly what you want to happen with your coaching journey.</p>
<p>The &quot;Future You&quot; arrived at the destination and sent a postcard back in time telling you all about it.</p>
<p>In a year from today, in an ideal world...</p>
<p>1. Where do you want to be?</p>
<p>2. What do you want to be doing?</p>
<p>3. What do you want to feel?</p>
<p>4. What adventures do you want to be having?</p>
<p>Whether it's climbing a mountain, biking across the world, going cliff diving, winning a competition, feeling like a ninja, or just fitting in to your old pants... <strong >imagine who and where you </strong><em ><b>could</b></em><strong> be one year from now</strong>.</p>
<p>Then capture that.</p>
<p>Clip photos. Make a Pinterest board. Put up a <a href="http://www.holycool.net/carpe-diem-calendar/" target="_blank" >Carpe Diem</a> calendar. Draw a picture. Call up a friend and make a ridiculous bet. Surf the web to find inspiration.</p>
<p>Find a little object that you'll use on your adventures (e.g., snorkel, tropical vacation bottle opener, Conan-the-Barbarian-style broadsword, hockey puck, your kid's picture, a sweatband, whatever) and set it by your computer as a reminder.</p>
<p>Write it down. Or, <a href="http://www.futureme.org/" target="_blank" >write a letter to your future self</a> and get it delivered to yourself a year from now.</p>
<p>However you choose to envision your future:</p>
<p>Imagine it.</p>
<p>Capture it.</p>
<p>Have fun with it.</p>
<p>The coaching journey is about using every day to practice getting one day closer to making the destination real.</p>
