<p><strong >Find a comfortable, quiet, private place.</strong></p>
<p><strong >Sit or lie down</strong>, whatever will allow you to be most still. The position doesn't matter as much as that you're relaxed.</p>
<p><strong >Get your timer going.</strong> Set a timer for 5 minutes, and forget about counting down manually. That's your timer's job. It'll take care of you.</p>
<p><strong >If you feel comfortable enough, close your eyes.</strong></p>
<p><strong >Start with a quick 30-second &quot;body scan&quot;.</strong> As you scan down your body from head to toe, think about consciously relaxing each muscle. Let everything sink downward. In particular, let your face droop.</p>
<p><strong >Now, focus on your breathing.</strong> You don't need to breathe in any special way. Just breathe and notice what it feels like. Observe how the air moves in and out.</p>
<p><strong >Count 10 breaths, observing each one.</strong> What does breathing feel like? Does it make any sound?</p>
<p><strong >Let thoughts drift in and out, like lazy cats.</strong> Let them wander in and quietly out. They'll be back. You don't need to hold on to them.</p>
<p><strong >Observe only. Don't judge.</strong> There is no &quot;should&quot;. If you think of something, <em >...Hey, there's a thought. OK, bye bye for now. Thanks for playing, thought.</em> If you hear a noise, or have an itch, simply think, <em >There's a noise</em> or <em >I have an itch</em>. Make a note of it, with reacting, then move on. Ideally, stay as still as possible, with as little movement as possible.</p>
<p><strong >Keep coming back to your breathing.</strong> The breath is an anchor the signal when your attention is back, and away from thought cycles.</p>
<p><strong >Repeat until your time is up. Open your eyes.</strong></p>
<p>That's all there is.</p>
