<p>Coach's Notes:&nbsp;Improving communication; asking for what one wants.</p> 
<form > 
<h1 >
<section id="ember118" >Practicing tough talk.</h1> 
<p><strong >Asking for what you want and need and facing difficult discussions pays off in physical, emotional, and mental health.</strong></p> 
<p>Let's say you have an interpersonal situation you want to change.</p> 
<p>Maybe things aren't going so well with your friend, your boss, or your spouse.</p> 
<p>Before we can talk about how to change it, we need to know why the situation is there, and what we want as the outcome.</p> 
</section>
<section id="ember119" > 
<ul type=disc > 
<li ><strong >What, ultimately, do you want</strong>&nbsp;to happen? (Notice that this isn't about what you&nbsp;<em >don't</em>&nbsp;want.)</li> 
<li ><strong >What, ultimately, is realistic</strong>&nbsp;given what you know of the situation?</li> 
<li ><strong >What's important to you</strong>—what are your priorities and values?</li> 
<li ><strong >What does it cost you to do nothing</strong>—to leave things as they are?</li> 
<li ><strong >Why do you want to change the situation?</strong>&nbsp;How will change benefit you?</li> 
<li ><strong >What options are there</strong>&nbsp;for changing it?</li> 
</ul> 
</section>
<section id="ember120" > 
<h1 >Being assertive</h1> 
<p>Of course, asking for what you need and want means being assertive.</p> 
<p><strong >Being assertive means that you interact productively with people while standing up for yourself.</strong>&nbsp;Being assertive doesn't mean you get whatever you want.</p> 
<p><strong >It means that you—and the people around you—know what you're about, and where you stand.</strong></p> 
<p>When you're assertive:</p> 
<ul type=disc > 
<li >You feel good about yourself.</li> 
<li >You live honestly and authentically, with integrity.</li> 
<li >You make yourself mentally, emotionally, and physically healthier.</li> 
<li >Other people know exactly what you stand for.</li> 
<li >Other people respect you.</li> 
</ul> 
<p>Assertive people:</p> 
<ul type=disc > 
<li >express their feelings, thoughts, and desires clearly and unambiguously—with compassion, thoughtfulness, and honesty;</li> 
<li >know their rights, and what they want and need; and</li> 
<li >control their anger so that it's productive, and used for positive change (it's not just &quot;letting people have it&quot; or &quot;saying what's on your mind&quot;).</li> 
</ul> 
<p>And often, being assertive means Saying Difficult Things.</p> 
</section>
<section id="ember121" > 
<h1 >Saying Difficult Things</h1> 
<p>Many things are difficult to say.</p> 
<p>Perhaps saying them feels shameful, awkward, or hard to articulate. People might get upset when we say them.</p> 
<p>Saying Difficult Things (aka SDT) can be utterly terrifying.</p> 
<p>Yet we must, at times, say these things. SDT is an act of self-preservation, self-respect, and self-care.</p> 
<p><strong >SDT means we have to have the courage to face someone's reaction, in order to say what must be said.</strong></p> 
<p>The sayer of Difficult Things must be willing to climb on that diving board, knees quaking, heart pounding.</p> 
<p>And then, jump off anyway.</p> 
</section>
<section id="ember122" > 
<p>SDT is not starting an argument or &quot;complaining&quot;. It's not &quot;being bitchy&quot;.</p> 
<p><strong >SDT is the clear, explicit, direct, unambiguous articulation of your truths and values.</strong></p> 
<p><em >&quot;It is not OK to...&quot;</em></p> 
<p><em >&quot;It is not acceptable to me that...&quot;</em></p> 
<p><em >&quot;Please stop...&quot; or &quot;Could you please do...&quot;</em></p> 
<p><em >&quot;When X happens, I feel Y. And so, from now on, Z.&quot;</em></p> 
<p><em >&quot;I need...&quot;</em></p> 
<p><em >&quot;X is bothering me because Y. I'd like to talk more about this.&quot;</em></p> 
<p><em >&quot;It's important to me that...&quot;</em></p> 
<p><strong >There is tremendous power in speaking truth and defining self-protective boundaries.</strong></p> 
<p>It brings us more in line with our authentic selves. It gives us a chance to say who we are, what we need, and what we stand for.</p> 
</section>
<section id="ember123" > 
<h1 >Start small</h1> 
<p>If you're jumping into those waters, it's OK to put on a life jacket first.</p> 
</section>
<section id="ember124" ><figure > 
<div class='figure'><img src='D:\PE\Procoach\Nutrition\Resource\img\500254dc-57dc-46ec-8d3e-8aa446f16711.jpg' width=100%></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<ul type=disc > 
<li ><strong >Find allies and supporters</strong>—maybe the best friend who's always straight with you, or your spouse who has great ideas about workplace strategy. Most likely, your problem isn't weird or unusual; other people have similar types of experiences or feelings.</li> 
<li ><strong >Come up with a plan beforehand.</strong></li> 
<li ><strong >Practice.</strong></li> 
</ul> 
<p>If you're facing a bully or someone who intimidates you, use a method that keeps you safe—and, at first, inhibits their immediate response. (This is one place where email can be used for good!)</p> 
<p>SDT may not create a massive revelation in the recipient, leading them to renounce their toxic behavior.</p> 
<p>However,&nbsp;<strong >it is 100% successful, because it tells people how to treat you, what you expect from your interactions, and where your boundaries are.</strong></p> 
<p>Sometimes SDT is not even about major things—the subject is difficult only because you're not used to doing it.</p> 
<p><strong >SDT is hard to do. Which is precisely why it can yield amazing results.</strong></p>
