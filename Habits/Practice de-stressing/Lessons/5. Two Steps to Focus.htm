<section id="ember113" >Commit to focus, and clear distractions.</h1>
<p>When you slow down enough to narrow your focus, you not only stress less, you may also end up getting more done in the long run—including getting healthier and fitter.</p>
<p><strong >You can practice focus in two ways:</strong></p>
<p>1. <strong >Fix your attention on an important goal, one aligned with living your values and priorities</strong>.<br > Remind yourself of these continually, and refocus as necessary.</p>
<p>2. <strong >Remove distractions</strong>.<br > This includes anything not aligned with your values and priorities.</p>
</section>
<section id="ember114" >
<h1 >1. Fix your attention on your priorities</h1>
<p><strong >Make your time match your values and what's important in your life.</strong></p>
<p>If &quot;getting healthy, eating well, and staying active&quot; isn't near the top of your priority list, how can you shift your schedule to change that? How can you reorganize your priorities in a way that centers around your goals?</p>
<p>Write out your top 3–5 priorities on a note, and stick the note where you can see it often. Take time to read and refocus on these priorities.</p>
<p>Each time a proposed task or activity comes up, check the note.</p>
<p><strong >Does that task fall into the priority list?</strong></p>
<ul type=disc >
<li ><strong >If yes, add it to your to-do list. Or do it now.</strong></li>
<li ><strong >If no, consider not doing it.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>The clearer your goals and priorities are to you—in a deep way that's felt emotionally and physically in the body—the easier this decision will be.</p>
</section>
<section id="ember115" >
<h1 >2. Clear distractions</h1>
<p><strong >Where are your time suckers and time wasters?</strong></p>
<p>With limited time and attention, don't let irrelevant distractions suck your focus and energy. The more distractions you can eliminate, the easier it will be to focus on your clear values and priorities.</p>
<p>Clearing distractions is like a makeover for your schedule. Clear out the time-sucking activity clutter. Make it easy for yourself to focus.</p>
