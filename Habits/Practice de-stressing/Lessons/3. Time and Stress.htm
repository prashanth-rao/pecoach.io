<section id="ember119" >How you perceive time defines your stress level.</h1>
<p>In their book <em >The Time Paradox</em>, psychologists Phil Zimbardo and John Boyd propose that <strong >the way we understand time affects the way we live our lives</strong>.</p>

<div class='figure'><img src='https://prashanth-rao.github.io/pecoach.io/Resource/img/f340b629-54ae-46cd-944b-2ec1098c2f04.jpg' width=100%></div>
<p> </p>
<p>They divide time perceptions into categories based on having a primary bias towards Past-, Present-, or Future-thinking.</p>
</section>
<section id="ember122" >
<h1 >Past-thinking: Positive and negative</h1>
<p><strong >Past-positive</strong></p>
<p>For Past-Positives, these folks' heads are full of happy memories. Any screw-ups are treated as learning experiences and they regret mostly the things they <em >didn't</em> do.</p>
<p>They're the ones who organize reunions.</p>
<p>Past-Positives tend to feel strongly rooted in their routines or social groups. Their behavior is strongly motivated by preserving positive past memories and circumstances.</p>
<p><strong >Past-negative</strong></p>
<p>For Past-Negatives, these folks look back on a past full of regret and perceived failure. They obsess about the &quot;mistakes&quot; they made and feel stuck ruminating about times they felt they messed up. Their behavior is strongly motivated by feeling guilt and looking for redemption or trying to undo past choices.</p>
</section>
<section id="ember123" >
<h1 >Present-thinking: Hedonism and fatalism</h1>
<p><strong >Present hedonism</strong></p>
<p>These people live for the present, immediate gratification, and having fun.</p>
<p>They're the party animals, the people who spend money as soon as they get it, and say things like &quot;live fast, die young, leave a good-looking corpse&quot;. They're not planning for the future because they're all set fully enjoying the present.</p>
<p><strong >Present fatalism</strong></p>
<p>These are the &quot;life's a bitch and then you die&quot; folks. They feel like there's not much point to anything, almost like their whole life is already determined for them.</p>
<p><em >Eh</em>, they say, <em >why bother to eat well—you'll just drop dead of something anyway.</em></p>
<p>Like present hedonists, they also spend little thought and planning for the future. However, that's mainly motivated out of a defeated sense of dis-empowerment in the future, rather than joy for the moment.</p>
</section>
<section id="ember124" >
<h1 >Future-thinking: Planning and transcending</h1>
<p><strong >Future planners</strong></p>
<p>These are the folks who are eternally frustrated trying to get the present hedonists to save for a rainy day.</p>
<p>Future planners are the people who floss, wear their seatbelts, schedule their workouts, and avoid smoking. They eat healthy because they can see how an investment now pays off later.</p>
<p>This perspective is a double-edged sword: Futures are organized. They can also be anxious and easily overwhelmed, when they feel that the future is now.</p>
<p><strong >Future transcendents</strong></p>
<p>Future transcendents are also planning, although less deliberately. Their planning and living for an abstract &quot;someday&quot;, rather than a specific, targeted goal. They may believe that &quot;someday&quot;—after some major event—life will <em >then</em> be awesome.</p>
<p>That could involve dying and going to heaven or, in everyday terms, &quot;winning the lottery&quot;, &quot;getting thin&quot;, or being &quot;discovered&quot; by a movie agent on the subway.</p>
<p>Future transcendents worry less about what they do today, because when that &quot;someday&quot; comes, everything will work out perfectly then.</p>
<p>In terms of health and coaching, future transcendents may believe that their lives will be dramatically different after an abstract, sudden weight loss event.</p>
<p><strong >We can have multiple ways of thinking about time, of course.</strong></p>
<p>We might be very future-oriented at work or with our money, but present-oriented when it comes to food decisions. We might plan departmental budgets for next year or save our cash, then outside the office we want that food now!!</p>

<h1 >Your time perception = your stress level</h1>
<p>The way we think about time is a stress management tool. Changing time perspectives can either build or ease stress in the body. Likewise, shifting time perspectives is a powerful tool towards reaching your goals.</p>
<p><strong >Time pessimism—whether past-negative, present-fatalist, or future-anxious—</strong><em ><b>creates</b></em><strong> stress.</strong></p>
<p>We're preoccupied with all the bad things that have happened, or could happen. Or we feel like there's no point to anything—we're victims of fate.</p>
<p><strong >Time optimism—whether past-positive, present-hedonist, or future-hopeful—</strong><em ><b>eases</b></em><strong> stress.</strong></p>
<p>We focus on the good things that have happened, are happening, or might happen.</p>
<p><strong >Time pro-activity—whether planning for the future or focusing on what can be done </strong><em ><b>right now</b></em><strong>, also lowers stress.</strong></p>
<p>When we plan (without over-planning), we feel more in control of our destiny. Stress comes from perceived lack of control. Feeling like we can't control anything is a great recipe for anxiety.</p>
<p>Luckily, just like other skills, time perception is practiced and learned. This means you can change, if you want to.</p>
<p><strong >Think about how your time perspective affects your stress levels and your coaching journey.</strong></p>

<section id="ember126" >
<h1 >The 5-minute action</h1>
<p>One of the easiest ways to decrease stress is to <strong >practice being in the present</strong>.</p>
<p>In the present, you can focus on:</p>
<ul type=disc >
<li >what you <em >already</em> have—whether that's skills, accomplishments, or life's little gifts;</li>
<li >what you are about to do—what actions you can take <em >immediately</em>; and</li>
<li >what small, manageable task you can tackle <em >right now</em>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Today, practice <strong >living in the present and take action</strong>.</p>
<p>Ask yourself, &quot;What can I do <em >in the next five minutes</em> to move towards where I want to be?&quot;</p>
<p>Then do it.</p>
<p>You can do <em >anything</em> for five minutes.</p>
<p>Five minutes of action is worth a whole lot of thinking.</p>
