<p>Coach's Notes:&nbsp;Brief overview of hormone issues and how they may affect body composition and progress.</p>

<section id="ember116" >In understanding how hormones affect your health and contentment, there are two basic points.</h1> 
<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong >Hormones are powerful drivers of your mental, emotional, and physical health.</strong>&nbsp;Generally, if hormones are out of whack, you'll be unhappy.</p> 
<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong >Hormones are irregular and unpredictable under chronic stress.</strong></p> 
</section>
<section id="ember117" > 
<h1 >Your body is like a factory</h1> 
<p>You're the executive controller of a massive hormonal factory.</p> 
<p>This factory is incredibly complicated: It operates around the clock with billions of workers. It makes hundreds of products, with exacting specifications, and coordinates millions of deliveries뾵ith perfect precision.</p> 
<p>Your hormones are the central communication system.</p> 
<p><strong >Your hormones control everything from the most basic to the most complicated functions.</strong></p> 
<p>For instance, hormones:</p> 
<ul type=disc > 
<li >adjust fluid and mineral levels in your body with to-the-microgram accuracy;</li> 
<li >keep your lungs breathing and your heart beating;</li> 
<li >control inflammation and immunity;</li> 
<li >regulate your body clock (circadian rhythms);</li> 
<li >control the &quot;idling speed&quot; of your metabolism;</li> 
<li >regulate reproduction, menstrual cycles, and sexuality;</li> 
<li >control appetite, hunger, and fullness뾞nd what your body does with any nutrients it receives.</li> 
</ul> 
<p>The scale of hormonal operations is mind-boggling.</p> 
</section>
<section id="ember118" > 
<h1 >The hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis</h1> 
<p>The hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis is a super highway of hormonal messages.</p> 
<p>Three endocrine (aka hormone-secreting) glands make up the HPA axis.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong >Hypothalamus</strong><br > The hypothalamus is a blob of cells deep in your brain. It connects your central nervous system to your hormonal system, and it's the &quot;master controller&quot; of almost all hormonal functions.</p> 
<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong >Pituitary</strong><br > The pituitary is the hypothalamus' right-hand person. It executes the orders given by the hypothalamus. Hormones released by the pituitary regulate:</p> 
<p>o&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; growth</p> 
<p>o&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; blood pressure</p> 
<p>o&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; lactation</p> 
<p>o&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; sexual and reproductive functions</p> 
<p>o&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; thyroid functions</p> 
<p>o&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; metabolism</p> 
<p>o&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; water and mineral balance</p> 
<p>o&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; body temperature</p> 
<p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong >Adrenals</strong><br > The adrenal glands sit on top of your kidneys and help regulate fluid and mineral balance. They also respond to stress by secreting hormones such as cortisol and adrenaline. Adrenals take their marching orders from the pituitary.</p> 
<p><strong >If your body were a ship:</strong></p> 
<ul type=disc > 
<li >the hypothalamus would be the captain;</li> 
<li >the pituitary would be the first mate; and</li> 
<li >the adrenal glands would be the emergency response, safety and cleanup crew.</li> 
</ul> 
</section>
<section id="ember121" ><figure > 
<div class='figure'><img src='D:\PE\Procoach\Nutrition\Resource\img\f5b90402-a270-435c-97ba-6208f4b00150.jpg' width=100%></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The system is called an &quot;axis&quot; because the three glands work together.</p> 
</section>
<section id="ember123" > 
<h1 >Stress and your HPA</h1> 
<p>Your hypothalamus, as the hormonal ship captain in the brain, gets input from many things, such as:</p> 
<ul type=disc > 
<li >light and dark cycles</li> 
<li >scent</li> 
<li >your heart, your stomach, and your reproductive organs</li> 
<li >your body fat levels</li> 
<li >your immune system</li> 
<li >physical, mental, and emotional stress</li> 
</ul> 
<p>When you're stressed, the hypothalamus in your brain kicks your HPA into action.</p> 
<p>A stressful situation is not a good time to make babies, digest food properly, or feel happy. As far as your hormones are concerned, stress is a time to fight or flee. All systems are on high alert.</p> 
<p>If the stress is chronic, then the HPA axis is working hard&nbsp;<em >all the time</em>. If the stress continues, the HPA starts shutting down the system to protect you.</p> 
</section>
<section id="ember124" > 
<h1 >Stressed system shutdown = hello body fat, goodbye sexytime</h1> 
<p>Importantly, the HPA axis connects to sex hormone production as well. This includes:</p> 
<ul type=disc > 
<li >estrogen</li> 
<li >progesterone</li> 
<li >testosterone</li> 
<li >follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH)</li> 
<li >luteinizing hormone (LH)</li> 
</ul> 
<p>Both men and women have these hormones in different amounts.</p> 
<p>Changes in adrenal stimulation change the function and regulation of sex hormones.</p> 
<p>That means that:</p> 
<ul type=disc > 
<li ><strong >Stress뾵hether physical, mental, or emotional뾱huts down proper sex hormone production.</strong></li> 
<li ><strong >When the HPA axis deals with chronic stress, it harms our reproductive function and sex lives.</strong></li> 
</ul> 
<p>Stress hormones, such as cortisol, compete with sex hormones.</p> 
<p>It's like the factory gets one big order, and has to focus all its production on that one customer뾠ortisol. No time for lovin' or babymakin' hormones뾖tress Inc. needs its delivery of cortisol.</p> 
<p><strong >When stress goes up, sex hormone production goes down</strong>, or goes out of whack.</p> 
</section>
<section id="ember125" > 
<h1 >How to get your hormones on track</h1> 
<p>De-stressing (like, importantly, with proper nutrition and regular뾟ut not excessive뾢xercise) supports your hormones functioning regularly and predictably.</p> 
<p><strong >When stress goes down, hormone function comes into balance.</strong></p> 
<p>With balanced hormones:</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong >It's easier to lose fat.</strong></p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong >It's easier to put on and keep lean body mass</strong>&nbsp;(muscle&nbsp;<em >and</em>&nbsp;bone).</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong >Your reproductive system works well</strong>: for women, menstrual cycles become regular, and periods are less painful; menopause symptoms are better controlled.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong >You look and feel better: your skin glows, you feel relaxed, arousal and orgasm are easier, you have abundant blood flow to all tissues.</strong></p> 
<p>To keep your hormones humming happily:</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong >Reduce stress</strong>&nbsp;in your life.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong >Actively pursue relaxation, self-acceptance, and mindfulness.</strong></p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong >Eat to&nbsp;</strong><em ><b>nourish</b></em>&nbsp;your body properly. Get enough protein, fat, and carbs. You need them all for hormone production.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong >Stay active but don't over-train</strong>&nbsp;or push your limits at every workout.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong >Get enough sleep.</strong></p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong >Be aware of how your thoughts and feelings change your body.</strong></p>
