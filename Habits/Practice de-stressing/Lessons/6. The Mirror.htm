<section id="ember117" >How food and fitness reflect values and priorities.</h1>
<p>Here's a simple but profound concept:</p>
<p><em >Your relationships with food, fitness, and health are the same as your relationships with your life, and with the people around you.</em></p>
<p>In other words, the health of your body is like a mirror for the rest of your life.</p>
<p><strong >What does your mirror show you about your life and relationships?</strong></p>

<h1 >What does your mirror reflect?</h1>
<p>For example, here's what some others in coaching have said about how food and exercise mirrors their lives:</p>
<ul type=disc >
<li ><em >Food is my friend... because I feel alone.</em></li>
<li ><em >Food is pleasure... because I don't have much pleasure elsewhere.</em> (Or, <em >I worry about being deprived… because it feels like I'm not getting enough of something elsewhere.</em>)</li>
<li ><em >Food has to be controlled... because my life is out of control.</em> (Or, <em >I lose control of food… because I spend all my energy trying to control the rest of my life.</em>)</li>
<li ><em >I'm afraid to ask for what I want when it comes to food... and I'm afraid to speak up in other areas of my life, too.</em></li>
<li ><em >Food is meant to be shared... because I love giving to other people.</em></li>
<li ><em >It's hard to take time for exercise... because I'm focused on taking care of other people, and it feels &quot;selfish&quot; to worry about my own needs.</em></li>
<li ><em >Fitness has to be &quot;tough&quot; and I have to be hard on myself... because I struggle to &quot;measure up&quot; to other people's expectations (or my own expectations of myself).</em></li>
<li ><em >I eat alone and shamefully... because I feel like I can't be open and honest elsewhere in my life.</em></li>
<li ><em >I love big family meals and traditional recipes... because my family bonds are strong, and I value my culture and heritage.</em></li>
<li ><em >When I eat slowly... it reminds me to &quot;stop and smell the roses&quot; in the rest of my life too.</em></li>
<li ><em >Food is love... and sometimes I can't say &quot;I love you&quot; another way.</em></li>
</ul>

<h1 >Voice of experience</h1>
<p>Here's one story of how changing daily food practices lead to massive transitions in other relationships in life.</p>
</section>
<section id="ember121" >
<p><em >&quot;Before starting coaching, my husband insisted that we already ate a 'healthy' diet, with relatively little processed food and lots of fresh vegetables. My expanding butt disagreed. And junk foods were displacing healthier choices.</em></p>
<p><em >It turns out that for many years, without fully recognizing it, I had been giving in to my partner's food preferences. I had made some small noises about buying organic meats and about our reliance on pasta meals. Yet mostly, I had kept my thoughts to myself.</em></p>
<p><em ><b>Defining and asking for what I wanted and needed was a key moment in my coaching journey… and my marriage.</b></em></p>
<p><em >That's not to say it happened without conflict or discord. I look at it as a work-in-progress. We're doing better all the time, talking openly and compromising.&quot;</em></p>

<h1 >Look into your mirror</h1>
<p>Look into your &quot;food, fitness and health mirror&quot;. What do you see there?</p>

<p> </p>
<ul type=disc >
<li >How do you approach food and eating?</li>
<li >Fitness and activity?</li>
<li >Health and wellness?</li>
</ul>
<p>How do you think about those things? What do you act in regards to those things?</p>
<p>What does your approach to these things tell you about:</p>
<ul type=disc >
<li >yourself?</li>
<li >your relationships with other people?</li>
<li >your values?</li>
<li >your life?</li>
</ul>
<p>What is <em >good</em> about your approach to these things?</p>
<p>What have been the most stubborn or surprising habits to change … and why?</p>
<p>How might your approach to these things reflect problems and challenges elsewhere?</p>
