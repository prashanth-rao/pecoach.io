<p>Coach's Notes:&nbsp;Suggested activities for de-stressing, encouraging people to &quot;find their oasis&quot; and capture it in their Owner's Manual. Why &quot;blowing off steam&quot; isn't necessarily ideal.</p>

<h1 >
<section id="ember108" >Chasing calm</h1> 
<p><strong >We can't be busy, excited, or rushing all the time.</strong>&nbsp;We need to balance with periods of quiet rejuvenation.</p> 
<p>That balance that we desperately need can be hard to find. Relaxation doesn't accidentally find us.</p> 
<p>Recovery doesn't accidentally find us.</p> 
<p>Calm doesn't accidentally find us.</p> 
<p><strong >De-stressing doesn't accidentally find us. We have to go get it.</strong></p>

<section id="ember109" > 
<h1 >De-stressing isn't &quot;blowing off steam&quot;.</h1> 
<p>It's not about engaging in high-energy, aggressive activities like:</p> 
<ul type=disc > 
<li >pounding the crap out of something in a kickboxing class</li> 
<li >pounding the crap out of yourself with high-intensity workouts</li> 
<li >screaming at the other idiots on the highway inside your closed car</li> 
</ul> 
<p>Blowing off steam isn't bad. Actually, it's awesome and important to turn healthy aggression outwards instead of inwards, in productive ways.</p> 
<p>Better we go ape on a punching bag, run some hard miles, or visit a&nbsp;<a href="http://www.battlesports.ca/rage-room/" target="_blank" >Rage Room</a>&nbsp;to get our frustrations out than yell at our kids or seethe silently until we explode.</p> 
<p>Still, those kind of activities, even if they're healthy and appropriate, are stimulating. They amp you up.</p> 
<p>The same is true of these other stimulating recreational activities:</p> 
<ul type=disc > 
<li >watching TV or movies</li> 
<li >surfing the internet</li> 
<li >playing video games</li> 
</ul> 
<p>While fun or even mentally relaxing, electronics send powerful stimulation to visual senses. Anything involving a screen is out as a reliable, sustainable recovery strategy.</p>

<h1 >What counts as de-stressing?</h1> 
<ul type=disc > 
<li >a relaxing walk</li> 
<li >being out in nature</li> 
<li >listening to relaxing music</li> 
<li >mindfulness practice and meditation</li> 
<li >massage</li> 
<li >deep breathing</li> 
<li >laughing (check out&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dpNS2l7jNs" target="_blank" >this guy</a>)</li> 
<li >snuggling a loved one or pet</li> 
<li >yoga, gentle mobility, and/or slow stretching exercises</li> 
<li >a solid, awesome, Kleenex-destroying cry, if you need it (crying actually helps us get rid of stress hormones)</li> 
<li >indulging in a trip to the salon to get your hair washed, or get a facial; or getting one of those dope old-school hot-towel shaves at your local barber</li> 
<li >gentle swimming or water immersion (such as a hot tub)</li> 
<li >relaxing in a sauna</li> 
<li >having sex (and here you thought getting healthy wouldn't be fun!)</li> 
<li >singing along to your favorite song (the breathing for singing competes with &quot;anxious breathing&quot;—and you end up diverting worry energy into belting out your power anthems)</li> 
<li >physical, non-competitive play, like dancing or tossing around a Frisbee</li> 
</ul> 
<p><strong >Think of de-stressing as&nbsp;</strong><em ><b>purposefully chasing relaxation.</b></em></p> 
<p>These also double as self-love and self-care. Necessary and deserving of all humans.</p>
