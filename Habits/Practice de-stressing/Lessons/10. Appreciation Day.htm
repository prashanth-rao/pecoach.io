<p>Making progress in health is never a trip you take alone. Even if it may feel that way sometimes, no one is an island. Other people and community have made vital contributions.</p>
<p>So let's appreciate them and say thanks.</p>

<h1 >Gratitude</h1>
<p>Look around your life, right now. Who's helped you get to where you are?</p>
<ul type=disc >
<li >Maybe your partner helped with food prep.</li>
<li >Maybe your friend worked out with you.</li>
<li >Maybe your dog was thrilled to go for walks with you.</li>
<li >Maybe your kid took your progress photos.</li>
<li >Maybe someone encouraged you when you were feeling bummed out.</li>
</ul>
<p>Make a list of all the people who have helped you along your journey, even in tiny ways—maybe without realizing it.</p>
<p><strong >Take a moment to feel grateful for these people and their help.</strong></p>

<section id="ember119" >
<h1 >Say thank you</h1>
<p>Practice saying thanks to the people who have helped you. Tell them exactly how they helped you.</p>
<p><em >&quot;Hey Alex, I really appreciate you hanging out with me at the gym. You always push me to get that last rep. Thanks, friend.&quot;</em></p>
<p><em >&quot;Bud, I want you to know how much I appreciate you helping me out with the grocery shopping. I know it's a lot of work, and it's been a big help to me. Thanks.&quot;</em></p>
<p><em >&quot;Billy, mom and dad are really glad you know how to use the digital camera, 'cause I can't figure the freaking thing out! If it wasn't for you, I wouldn't be able to record all this progress! Thanks kiddo!&quot;</em></p>

<section id="ember120" >
<h1 >Appreciate through action</h1>
<p>Saying &quot;thanks&quot; is a great start.</p>
<p>If you can, go one step further. Show your appreciation through action. Do something to show gratitude, even if it's small.</p>
<ul type=disc >
<li >Help someone else out.</li>
<li >Take a gym newbie under your wing.</li>
<li >Treat your loved one(s) to something special.</li>
<li >Bring someone a thank you gift.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong >Find one person to whom you can show appreciation through action. Walk the talk. Pay it forward.</strong></p>
<p>And enjoy the health benefits of gratitude.</p>
