<p>Coach's Notes:&nbsp;Sexual health.</p> 
<form > 
<h1 >
<section id="ember113" >Being healthy includes sexuality too.</h1> 
<p>And sexuality is more than looking good in a bikini.</p> 
<p>Sexual health involves three basic things:</p> 
<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong >Being able to enjoy and control your own sexuality in a way that's meaningful to you</strong>, whether that's swinging from the chandelier at a play party, getting frisky with your long-time partner, or spending some quality time with yourself.</p> 
<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong >Freedom from fear, shame, guilt, false beliefs, and other psychological factors</strong>&nbsp;that affect your sexual response and your relationships.</p> 
<p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong >Good physical health</strong>—freedom from health problems that interfere with full hormonal functioning.</p> 
<p>In other words, sexual health involves the capacity and ability to feel good sexually.</p> 
</section>
<section id="ember114" > 
<h1 >Hormones</h1> 
<p>Hormones play a big part in our sexual health.</p> 
<p>For women, estrogen and progesterone keep ovaries cranking, booties and boobs bodacious, and sexual response robust. Before menopause, natural estradiol and progesterone help bodies stay lean and healthy.</p> 
<p>For both men and women (men especially), testosterone gives you mojo.</p> 
<p>When our hormones are healthy, we're more likely to feel sexy, and our bodies respond well to mental, emotional, and physical stimuli.</p> 
<p>De-stressing lowers cortisol and keeps sex hormone production humming along, for full support of an active sex life, if you choose.</p> 
</section>
<section id="ember115" > 
<h1 >Your brain: your biggest sex organ</h1> 
<p>As the sexperts are fond of saying, the biggest sexual organ is the brain.</p> 
<p>The way we think and feel about ourselves, our relationships, our lives, and our bodies dramatically affects our sexual health and our sexual response.</p> 
<p>Living healthy changes the way we think and feel. How we relate to our bodies, and to other people. That extends to sexuality as well. When you take care of yourself, you're saying&nbsp;<em >&quot;My body is an important part of who I am.&quot;</em></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>That alone can make you feel sexier.</p> 
</section>
<section id="ember118" > 
<h1 >Your body, yourself</h1> 
<p>However, some people feel that sexuality is a roadblock for them.</p> 
<p><strong >If you're encountering issues with sexuality and relationships, don't ignore them</strong>. Find support.</p> 
<p><strong >Being and acting sexual is your birthright. It's part of overall health.</strong></p> 
<p>Of course, each person's sex life is unique. Sexuality changes over time, with different partners, in different situations. Just like your fitness and nutrition, take responsibility for your sexuality. If you haven't already done so, learn its nuances.</p> 
<p><strong >What&nbsp;</strong><em ><b>your</b></em><strong>&nbsp;sexual health looks like is up to you.</strong></p> 
<p>If you think that your sexual health could use a little assistance from a doctor, therapist, or counselor, set your embarrassment aside, and go get what you need.</p> 
<p>Don't suffer in silence and shame. You're not a weirdo, and we guarantee you're not the only one.</p> 
<p>If you're already rockin' your bod and enjoying taking it out for a spin—fantastic. Keep up that core work.</p>
