<p>Coach's Notes:&nbsp;The benefits of &quot;uni-tasking&quot; rather than multi-tasking.</p> 
<form > 
<h1 >
<section id="ember106" >Minimize multitasking, focus on in-the-moment unitasking.</h1> 
<p><strong >Unitasking is a practice of immersing yourself fully in the execution of the present moment.</strong></p> 
<p>It's an ability to be more fully aware of questions like:</p> 
<ul type=disc > 
<li >What exactly is happening in this moment?</li> 
<li >What do I want to get out of this moment?</li> 
</ul> 
<p>For example, that could mean paying more direct attention to tasks like:</p> 
<ul type=disc > 
<li >Taking out the garbage, rather than multi-tasking while listening to music.</li> 
<li >Waiting for the bus, rather than multi-tasking while checking email.</li> 
<li >Driving, rather than multi-tasking while talking on the phone or texting.</li> 
<li >Prepping or eating food, rather than multi-tasking while watching TV.</li> 
</ul> 
<p>Whatever moment and task you choose to practice with, give it your full attention. Try to minimize or mentally filter other distractions. Then, when that task is fully done, move on to the next thing.</p>

<h1 >Training the skill of attention</h1> 
<p>Doing one thing at a time can help you:</p> 
<ul type=disc > 
<li ><strong >slow down, pay attention, and focus</strong>. On a path towards any goal and long-term change, focus is essential to success.</li> 
<li ><strong >think about what's truly important to you.</strong>&nbsp;A stronger skill of focusing your attention means you get to make more conscious choices with that attention. If you have only limited attention, where do you choose to spend it?</li> 
<li ><strong >lower your stress level.</strong>&nbsp;After practice, this skill can be on-demand to you at any time. It's a reliable strategy for staying calm and productive during your most stressful times.</li> 
</ul> 
<p><strong >Think about how to apply what you observe to your coaching journey.</strong></p> 
<p>How can you stay focused on your goals and your daily practices? Where and how do you get distracted?</p> 
<p>Expect this to be challenging. That's OK. As always, notice and name whatever you think or observe about yourself while doing this.</p>
