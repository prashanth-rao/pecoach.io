<p>Most of us can't go from 0 to 100 first thing in the morning—from deep sleep to super-energized.</p> 
<p>So it makes sense that we also can't go from 100 to 0 at night. Especially after being amped up and over stimulated by a busy, activity-packed day.</p> 
<p>To get better sleep, we often need to build better sleep prep practices, and keep those practices a daily priority.</p>

<h1 >Your secret weapon for snoozing: A sleep ritual</h1> 
<p>A sleep ritual is a set of behaviors that helps ease the transition between being awake and being asleep. The sleep ritual tells the brain:&nbsp;<em >Hey, it's time to calm down now. Stop thinking about that to-do list, and focus on shut-eye.</em></p> 
<p>The reality is:</p> 
<p><strong >We can't actually control how much sleep we get.</strong></p> 
<p>Or how well we sleep. Especially if you're dealing with stuff like small children, sleep apnea, shift work, or other environmental factors that can keep you awake, regardless of your personal effort and best intentions.</p> 
<p>The good news is: By adopting a sleep ritual before bed,&nbsp;<strong >we can improve our odds of getting a good night's sleep.</strong></p>

<h1 >Keep it simple and doable.</h1> 
<p>Start with a basic sleep ritual, even if it's only 10–15 minutes at &#64257;rst. (If you can, aim for a minimum of 30 minutes).</p>
