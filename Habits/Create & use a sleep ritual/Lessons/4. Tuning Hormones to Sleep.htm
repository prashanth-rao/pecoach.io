<h2 align=center >When you're rocking the sleep ritual but still not snoozing, other factors could be involved.</h2> 
<p>Coach's Notes:&nbsp;Some other reasons for poor or short sleep (e.g. hormonal issues).</p> 
<form > 
<h1 >
<section id="ember117" >If sleep continues to elude you, it could be hormones.</h1> 
<p>You've dimmed the lights. Turned off the electronics. Relaxed. Gotten into bed, shut your eyes, and thought of a calm blue ocean. And you still can't sleep.</p> 
</section>

<div class='figure'><img src='D:\PE\Procoach\Nutrition\Resource\img\b67abe04-2763-42c4-ae7f-948d3b245eba.jpg' width=100%></div>

<p>Thanks for nothing, calm blue ocean.</p>

<p>Some hormones, like melatonin and growth hormone, help us sleep. They make us feel drowsy, and they rejuvenate and rebuild our body while we're in dreamland.</p> 
<p>But some hormones—while they help us lose fat and stay healthy during the day—can cause problems at night. Below are a few more common hormonal concerns.</p> 
</section>
<section id="ember120" > 
<h1 >Cortisol and adrenaline can keep you awake</h1> 
<p>Cortisol helps &quot;unlock&quot; stored body fat so you can use it as energy. Adrenaline (<em >aka</em>&nbsp;epinephrine) does the same thing, especially if our cortisol stores are low (like when we're chronically stressed).</p> 
<p>So we want both to be&nbsp;<strong >lower when we're trying to relax</strong>, like before bed.</p> 
</section>
<section id="ember121" ><figure > 
<div class='figure'><img src='D:\PE\Procoach\Nutrition\Resource\img\41b1a24e-0061-4ce4-b512-6e6d1679c08c.jpg' width=100%></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>But if&nbsp;<strong >we're chronically stressed, cortisol and adrenaline might stay high, or ebb and &#64258;ow at the wrong times</strong>. This leaves us feeling &quot;wired and tired&quot;—desperate to sleep but buzzing.</p> 
<p>Or, we might get the classic 4 a.m. &quot;blast out of bed&quot; wakeup as adrenaline kicks in to free up some overnight blood sugar.</p> 
<p>If you can't go to sleep, high cortisol may be contributing. If you wake up early, it could be adrenaline (and low cortisol, which gets depleted by chronic stress).</p> 
</section>
<section id="ember123" ><figure >

<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<h1 >Thyroid issues</h1> 
<p>If you're over 35 or under chronic stress, there's a greater chance your thyroid may be out of balance.</p> 
<p>Think of thyroid metabolism as the &quot;idling speed&quot; of your body engine.</p> 
<ul type=disc > 
<li >Low thyroid can slow down many body processes and lead to fatigue, weakness, lack of energy, and trouble falling—and staying—asleep.</li> 
<li >Overactive thyroid revs you up, creating anxiety and restlessness. The excess energy can make it dif&#64257;cult for the body to know when it's time to shut down for the night.</li> 
</ul> 
</section>
<section id="ember125" > 
<h1 >Estrogen, progesterone, and menopause</h1> 
<p>Find yourself kicking off the blankets in the middle of the night and wondering if your sheets are on &#64257;re? If you're a female in your late 30s or early 40s, sleep disruptions could be related to menopause.</p> 
<p>As ovaries slow their production of&nbsp;<strong >estrogen</strong>, it can lead to waking up in the night or experiencing &quot;night sweats&quot; or hot &#64258;ashes.</p> 
<p><strong >Progesterone</strong>, the other &quot;female hormone&quot;, also declines during monopause, often more quickly than estrogen. Since progesterone has a calming effect, low progesterone can also affect sleep.</p> 
<p>Symptoms can get worse if:</p> 
<ul type=disc > 
<li >You're stressed, aren't eating a nutritious diet, or have excess body fat.</li> 
<li >You're on a major exercise tear (especially endurance training, such as long-distance running)</li> 
<li >You've been on a long-term restrictive diet</li> 
</ul> 
</section>
<section id="ember126" > 
<h1 >What can you do about it?</h1> 
<p>Nutrition, movement and your environment are powerful regulators of our hormones.</p> 
<p><strong >Include a handful of high-&#64257;ber, slow-digesting smart carbs at every meal</strong>. Carbs help with hormone synthesis (including the feel-good sleepytime hormone serotonin) and curbing hunger.</p> 
<p><strong >Eat about every 3–4 hours, when you're hungry</strong>. Don't fast or skip meals.</p> 
<p><strong >Balance any intense training with more relaxed activities</strong>, like yoga or going for a walk.</p> 
<p><strong >Get bright light while you're awake and darken your environment as much as possible before bed.</strong>&nbsp;This will help re-set your hormonal clock.</p> 
<p><strong >If you're concerned about underlying hormonal problems, consult with your health care provider</strong>&nbsp;to explore further options.</p> 
<p>And now... it's time to dim all the lights, baby. Ohhhh yeahhhh. Snnnnzzzzkkkkkk.</p>
