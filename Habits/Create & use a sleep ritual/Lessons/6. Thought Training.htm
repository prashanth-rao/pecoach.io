<section id="ember113" >The brain is a muscle. Thought patterns, like all muscle movement patterns, can be practiced and trained.</h1>
<p>Remember the last time you watched your favorite team win a game? Or got freaked out by a horror movie? Or imagined something bad happening to someone you love?</p>
<p>What was that like?</p>
<p>Specifically, how did your body react?</p>
<p>Maybe your heart beats faster. You start sweating. Feeling excited or anxious, as if you were actually scoring that winning goal, or running away from the guy with the axe.</p>
<p>When, in reality, those things were imagined. Nothing was really happening to you.</p>
<p>Whether the event is real or imagined, the responses in the body are the same. Those body responses are <strong >real</strong>.</p>
<p>The brain uses the same parts to imagine things as it does to actually experience them. To the brain, thoughts, observations, and emotions are always reality.</p>

<h1 >The mental game is powerful</h1>
<p>The &quot;mental game&quot; means: What are you imagining? What thoughts are you focusing on?</p>
<p>The mental game is critical in reaching goals.</p>
<p><strong >If you focus on your destination and mentally rehearse how you're going to get there, you're more likely to succeed.</strong></p>
<p>If you focus on being a problem-solver, someone who meets challenges with resilience and creativity, that's what you will be.</p>
<p>On the other hand, if you focus on &quot;failures&quot; or setbacks (whatever you imagine those to be), your body and behavior will respond. Negative thinking could leave you feeling physically paralyzed or stuck.</p>

<section id="ember116" >
<h1 >You can change your thoughts.</h1>
<p>With practice, the patterns you have of beliefs, thoughts, and perceptions of the world can all be changed.</p>
<p>The practice can start with questions:</p>
<p>1. What thoughts and mental images am I creating?</p>
<p>2. Do they help me?</p>
<p>3. Are they focused on success and resilience?</p>
<p>4. When I dwell on them, how does my body respond?</p>
<p>This is a practice of taking ownership of your mental environment and the reality it creates.</p>
