<section id="ember120" >Good or bad. Rigid or flexible. It's all in how you look at it.</h1>
<p>To build the mental skills needed to stick with a practice and reach goals (like living a healthy life), <strong >reframing</strong> + <strong >refocusing</strong> + <strong >resilience</strong> = results.</p>

<h1 >The mental skills</h1>
<p>1. <strong >Reframing</strong></p>
<p>2. <strong >Refocusing</strong></p>
<p>3. <strong >Resilience</strong></p>
<p>These are all mental skills.</p>
<p><strong >Mental skills, like any skill, can be practiced and learned.</strong></p>
<p>You aren't doomed from birth to think or feel a certain way forever, any more than you're doomed from birth never to play the oboe or learn calligraphy.</p>

<h1 >1. Reframing: Check and set your attitude</h1>
<p>Imagine you're a &#64257;lm director who's been hired to &#64257;lm the movie about your life. Look back on all your experiences and memories through a camera lens. What do you focus on? Whatever you choose to focus on is your <em >frame</em>.</p>

<p><strong >Your frame shapes your attitude and how you interpret your life.</strong></p>
<p>If you use a &quot;negative frame&quot; and shoot your life as a tragedy, that's what it will be. If you use a &quot;positive frame&quot; and shoot your life as an exciting adventure, that's what it will be.</p>
</section>
<section id="ember126" >
<p>Let's say you have a car accident. You're OK but shaken up, and the car is totaled.</p>
<p>A &quot;negative frame&quot; would shoot this event as <em >&quot;Oh my gawd! How awful! Poor me—my car is trashed!&quot;</em></p>
<p>A &quot;positive frame&quot; would shoot this event as <em >&quot;Oh my gawd! I am so lucky! Cheated death again! This af&#64257;rms my commitment to live life to the fullest—as if every moment could be my last! Also, this blood makes me look like a total badass.&quot;</em></p>
<p>Same car accident. Different framing.</p>
</section>
<section id="ember127" >
<p><strong >In determining what your emotional response to a situation will be, the actual events matter a lot less. Framing matters a lot more.</strong></p>
<p>Here are three quick ways to &quot;reframe&quot; your perspective.</p>
<p>1. <strong >Reframe problems as opportunities.</strong><br > How can you learn and grow from challenges?</p>
<p>2. <strong >Reframe &quot;negative&quot; qualities as &quot;superpowers&quot;.</strong><br > Flip the negativity over. If you spend a lot of time daydreaming, maybe your superpower is imagination and creativity.</p>
<p>3. <strong >Reframe &quot;I have to…&quot; as &quot;I get to…&quot;</strong><br > Instead of &quot;I have to go to the gym&quot;, try &quot;I get to go to the gym and burn off some stress!&quot;</p>
</section>
<section id="ember128" >
<h1 >2. Refocusing: How to get back on track</h1>
<p>Your interpretation of your experiences is based on what you pay attention to. And, what you pay attention to will grow.</p>
<p>Learning to deliberately direct your attention is a skill. As all skills, getting good at it takes practice.</p>
<p>Practice developing a re-focusing plan in advance. For example, that could be:</p>
<ul type=disc >
<li ><strong >A &quot;refocusing ritual&quot;</strong>. Many athletes have one such as brushing off their hands to symbolize brushing off the last event.</li>
<li ><strong >A simple verbal trigger</strong> that reminds you to pay attention (e.g., &quot;Back on track.&quot;).</li>
<li ><strong >A tried-and-true routine</strong>, such as a few familiar go-to meals or strategies.</li>
<li ><strong >Imagining &quot;parking&quot; your concerns and distractions &quot;outside&quot;</strong> while you take care of business in the gym.</li>
<li ><strong >Getting a quick motivational hit</strong> of your &quot;power song&quot; or favorite motivational video or quote.</li>
</ul>
<p>And remember…</p>
<ul type=disc >
<li ><strong >You will be distracted</strong>. Stuff <em >will</em> happen. That's OK. That's normal.</li>
<li ><strong >You will need to deal with interruptions, distractions, and an &quot;imperfect&quot; life.</strong></li>
<li ><strong >There is no such thing as a &quot;losing streak&quot;</strong>—every moment is a chance to get back in the game.</li>
</ul>
<p>Be prepared and have a plan to get back on track.</p>
</section>
<section id="ember129" >
<h1 >3. Resilience: Bounce back</h1>
<p>All humans are born with a capacity for resilience. Meaning, we have the ability to recover and regroup after a crisis. Humans are driven to survive.</p>
<p>Resilience is a <em >process</em>, rather than a specific action. Resilience is a frame of mind, a way of looking at the world.</p>
<p><strong >To practice resilience, practice the mindset that: No matter what happens to you, you can trust your innate ability to survive... and eventually thrive again.</strong></p>
<p>Mental and physical tension affects resilience.</p>
<ul type=disc >
<li >When we're open to learning and change, accept discomfort and newness (even when it's not fair or right), and adjust our balance &quot;on the &#64258;y&quot;, we keep moving forward.</li>
<li >When we're rigid and in&#64258;exible, fear moving in any direction, and try to control the minutiae of our experiences, we end up exhausted and running—very slowly and awkwardly.</li>
</ul>
