<section id="ember106" >Commitment is saying:&nbsp;<em >I WILL do this</em>.</h1> 
<p>When you commit to something, you make participation non-negotiable.</p> 
<p>For example, you might...</p> 
<p><strong >Commit to doing what matters.</strong></p> 
<p>You do the daily practices and essential behaviors that you know are getting you where you want to go.</p> 
<p><strong >Commit to confronting your challenges.</strong></p> 
<p>You keep going even when you face setbacks. You persist in the face of fears and obstacles. You face the dif&#64257;cult-dif&#64257;cult. You're in the commitment for the long haul.</p> 
<p><strong >Commit to yourself.</strong></p> 
<p>You're making a commitment to prioritize what's best for your health. In turn, being a better version of yourself serves your family, friends, and people closest to you.</p>

<h1 >Do you want to refresh your commitment?</h1> 
<p>Every day (every moment) is a chance to renew your commitment to yourself, your goals, or your coaching journey.</p> 
<p>What got you in this to begin with? What are the deepest reasons you're doing what you're doing? Are you still driven by that?</p> 
<p>What's changed? What can you shift? What's non-negotiable? What's so important to you that you're staying relentlessly committed to it?</p>
