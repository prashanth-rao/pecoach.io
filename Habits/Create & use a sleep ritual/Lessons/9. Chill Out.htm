<section id="ember113" >Too much stress and anxiety can be like a parking brake on your performance.</h1> 
<p><strong >Think of two scenarios when you had to perform a task.</strong></p> 
<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp; First, remember a time where you were very anxious, maybe rushing, or a time when you were so stressed out and tense about doing a good job you were practically vibrating.</p> 
<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp; Now, remember a time where you felt relaxed and open, totally focused and &quot;in the zone&quot;, having a great time.</p> 
<p>In which scenario did you&nbsp;<em >perform</em>&nbsp;better?</p> 
<p>In which scenario did you&nbsp;<em >feel</em>&nbsp;better?</p> 
<p>In which scenario was the outcome more successful?</p> 
<p>While it could seem like focusing on the stressful elements of a situation would help you do better, the opposite is true.</p> 
<p>While a little bit of stress sharpens our attention, too much is like trying to drive forward with the parking break on.</p> 
<p><strong >There's a zone of &quot;optimal stress&quot;—neither too much nor too little.</strong></p>

<h1 >Relaxation is a habit</h1> 
<p><strong >When you're relaxed and feeling good, you're more likely to make thoughtful choices, understand and remember things, and perform well at whatever you're doing.</strong></p> 
<p>You'll also be more likely to view mistakes as learning experiences rather than failures.</p> 
<p>When it comes to health, that perspective is essential for a leaner, healthier, stronger body in the long run.</p>

<h1 >How to actively chill out</h1> 
<p>Here's an easy way to start relaxing:</p> 
<p><strong >Focus on your breathing.</strong></p> 
<p>Try this exercise before getting to sleep:</p> 
<ul type=disc > 
<li >Lie down comfortably on your back. Close your eyes.</li> 
<li >Put one hand on your belly and one hand on your chest. (You can also use a pillow on your stomach, if you like.)</li> 
<li >First, focus on what the belly hand is doing. Ideally, the belly hand is rising up and down gently as you breathe.</li> 
<li >Then, focus on what the other hand is doing. Ideally, the chest hand is still. A sign that you're breathing deeply from a fully engaged abdomen rather than your chest.</li> 
<li >Breathe in—belly expands, hand goes up. Try to expand your belly to the ceiling.</li> 
<li >Breathe out—belly lowers, hand goes down. Try to push your navel to the ground.</li> 
<li >Take 20 slow, mindful &quot;belly breaths&quot;. Don't rush.</li> 
</ul>

<section id="ember117" ><figure > 
<div class='figure'><img src='D:\PE\Procoach\Nutrition\Resource\img\7e1570cc-21b1-4184-8c6c-a58260cd87a1.gif' width=100%></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<ul type=disc > 
<li >You don't have to think about anything in particular besides your belly hand going up and down.</li> 
</ul> 
<p><strong >That's it.</strong>&nbsp;Notice how you feel and how the breathing changed your heart rate. Is there change? Are you a calmer? More focused?</p> 
</section>
<section id="ember119" > 
<h1 >Breathing is always with you. Use this technique anytime.</h1> 
<p>Use this technique anytime you want to relax, standing or sitting. It can take as little as 30 seconds or less to chill and focus on your breath.</p> 
<p>Use it with eating. Take a few deep breaths before each meal. And if you find yourself rushing during the meal, stop for a couple of belly breaths.</p>
