<section id="ember114" >For many people, sleep time is whatever time is left over at the end of the day.</h1>
<p>Life is busy. Sleep can easily become a last priority. The reality is, especially within a busy life, taking ownership of prioritizing sleep is vital. We can't be healthy and happy without it.</p>

<h1 >What's so great about sleep?</h1>
<p><strong >Sleep restores </strong><em ><b>everything</b></em><strong> in the body</strong>: Our immune, nervous, skeletal, hormonal, and muscular systems.</p>
<p><strong >Sleep helps regulate our metabolism</strong>, including blood sugar and insulin levels. Eventually, chronically inadequate sleep is linked to gaining fat and risks of diabetes.</p>
<p><strong >Sleep helps us make and recall memories</strong>. People think, learn, and make decisions better when well-rested. Healthy adults need at least 7 hours of sleep per night, and sometimes more.</p>

<h1 >Light makes our body clocks tick</h1>
<p>The body's cycles run on timing directed by an internal clock, called our circadian rhythm. Internal clocks are driven by many external cues. One of the strongest external cues is <strong >exposure to light</strong>.</p>

<p> </p>
<p>Few of us wake up with the sun rising and go to bed when it sets. Other artificial sources of light now commonly interfere with our body clock.</p>
<p><strong >Daytime light is great</strong>. It wakes us up and regulates us. Exposure, especially early in the day, is critical to quality sleep.</p>
<p><strong >Nighttime light is not so great</strong>. It messes with our body clock, making it harder to fall asleep and/or stay asleep. Reduce or eliminate it as much as you can. For example:</p>
<ul type=disc >
<li >Turn off your electronic screens—If you absolutely must be on your computer late at night, dim the brightness or try this little app: <a href="https://www.xn--justgetux-cs73c.com/" target="_blank" >F.Lux</a>.</li>
<li >Use a dim alarm clock, and/or cover it up.</li>
<li >Get good curtains.</li>
</ul>

<h1 >More sleep, better health</h1>
<p><strong >Sleep regulates our metabolism and helps keep us lean and healthy.</strong></p>
<p>The later we go to bed and the shorter our sleep hours, the more likely we are to gain weight over time.</p>
<p>And because sleep helps regulate our blood sugar, lack of sleep can actually cause or worsen insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes. In healthy people, they can make the risk factors for those diseases more likely.</p>
<p><strong >An earlier sleep time can also mean less eating.</strong></p>
<p>Many folks &#64257;nd that late night is a comforting time for a snack. At 11 p.m., the snack is rarely steamed broccoli. Staying in bed can reduce the temptation. Plus, being well-rested usually means fewer food cravings and smarter choices the next day.</p>
<p><strong >More sleep makes you feel happier and saner.</strong></p>
<p>Abnormal circadian rhythms have been associated with depression, bipolar disorder and seasonal affective disorder.</p>
