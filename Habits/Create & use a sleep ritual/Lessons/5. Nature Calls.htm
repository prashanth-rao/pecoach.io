<section id="ember109" >Nature: the world's cheapest stress buster</h1> 
<p>Despite our 21st-century society, we are still creatures of nature. Nature calms us. Focuses us. Puts us at ease.</p> 
<p>When we're out in nature, our heart rate and blood pressure drop. Our breathing slows. We sleep and feel better. We get a blast of positive energy.</p> 
<p>At the University of Washington, researchers measured volunteers' stress in an office setting. First, they stressed them out with some puzzles. Then, they measured how long it took people to relax.</p> 
<p>If volunteers had a window overlooking a nature scene (grass, trees and a public fountain), their heart rate dropped faster than if there was a TV screen displaying the same view. In fact, the TV screen was no more calming than looking at a blank wall.</p> 
<p>Another study looked at subjects suffering from stress and burnout. This study compared relaxation indoors with relaxation outdoors, in a natural setting.</p> 
<p>Not only did subjects feel better in the natural setting, they felt more energetic, they were more able to focus on the present moment, and their sensory awareness increased when they were out in nature.</p>

<p>Research shows that being in nature gives us:</p> 
<ul type=disc > 
<li >more vitality—a sense of energy and aliveness</li> 
<li >better focus and clarity</li> 
<li >better ability to cope with life's demands</li> 
<li >better resistance to illness and poor health</li> 
<li >mental stimulation without mental exhaustion—in other words, there's stuff to keep us entertained without overstimulating us</li> 
</ul> 
<p>Plus, we're often more active and social when we're outside.</p>

<h1 >Back to nature</h1> 
<p>&quot;Nature&quot; can involve several things:</p> 
<ul type=disc > 
<li >plants</li> 
<li >animals</li> 
<li >weather and fresh air</li> 
<li >water</li> 
<li >light from natural sources: sun, moon, stars (and the ways in which light changes over a day, or with the seasons)</li> 
<li >sounds (such as birds singing)</li> 
<li >smells (such as flowers or fresh-cut grass)</li> 
<li >physical sensations (such as warm sun, raindrops, or wind on one's face)</li> 
</ul> 
<p><strong >Today, go outside and find something natural</strong>, even if it's a small patch of grass or a potted plant.</p> 
<p><strong >Turn off your phone and iPod, and go out of communication range</strong>&nbsp;during these few minutes.</p> 
<p><strong >Take 5-10 minutes to sit quietly and observe something natural</strong>, such as a tree. Or go for a walk in a natural setting, such as a park. Find your spot, or get into a good walking pace, and breathe deeply. Slowly.</p> 
<p>Shut your eyes and notice how your other senses pick up information immediately. Suddenly you can hear birds or your own footsteps.</p> 
<p>Notice:</p> 
<ul type=disc > 
<li ><strong >What you feel physically</strong>: wind, cold, warmth, rain, etc.</li> 
<li ><strong >What you see</strong>: What does the light look like? What are the leaves doing?</li> 
<li ><strong >What you smell</strong>: Leaves? Dirt? Fresh air?</li> 
<li ><strong >What you hear</strong>: Squirrels nattering? The wind in the trees?</li> 
<li ><strong >How your sense of time changes</strong>: What season is it? What time of day? Are things going quickly or slowly?</li> 
</ul> 
<p>Focus on what you are experiencing&nbsp;<strong >right now</strong>, this moment.</p>
