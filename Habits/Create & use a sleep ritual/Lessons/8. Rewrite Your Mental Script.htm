<p>Coach's Notes:&nbsp;Introduction to the idea that we &quot;write our own stories&quot;; call out and surface own stories for our lives and identities, and consider how to write them differently.</p>

<h1 >
<section id="ember112" >The self-talk that works for you.</h1> 
<p>The brain is constantly chatting away with itself—whether that's in words, images, or feelings.</p> 
<p>Most of the time, the self-talk happens underneath conscious awareness. Whether conscious or unconscious, thoughts lead to physical body changes in mood and experience.</p> 
<p>Likewise, it makes sense that:</p> 
<p><strong >Negative self-talk makes us feel like crap.</strong></p> 
<p>If we criticize ourselves, imagine negative things, tell ourselves we're stupid failures, etc., the body will treat that as a legitimate threat, leading to feeling physically defeated, anxious, and/or paralyzed. (And maybe having high school &#64258;ashbacks.)</p> 
<p><strong >Positive self-talk makes us feel good, and feeling on track.</strong></p> 
<p>If we focus on thoughts of small wins, what's going well, self-compassion, and trust, the body will respond positively. Positive thoughts will lead to healthier outcomes, like feeling energized, creative, relaxed, secure, and open to learning and getting better.</p> 
</section>
<section id="ember113" > 
<h1 >Negative self-talk doesn't work</h1> 
<p>Rather than encouraging growth, negative self-talk creates stress that shuts down performance and inhibits learning.</p> 
<p><strong >Mean thoughts make you worse.</strong></p> 
<p>Thoughts occur in the patterns that are practiced. Eventually, chronic negative self-talk becomes like a tired old script, re-running over and over and over.&nbsp;<em >(Blah blah blah, you suck, work harder, blah blah.)</em></p> 
<p>Because thought patterns are trained, they can be changed.</p> 
</section>
<section id="ember114" > 
<h1 >Practice positive self-talk</h1> 
<p>Positive self-talk—encouraging yourself, pointing out successes, or being compassionate in the face of challenges—leads to growth and improvement.</p> 
<p>Positive self-talk is a skill. And like any skill, you can improve it by practicing.</p> 
<p>That doesn't mean doing empty af&#64257;rmations—like reciting mantras without the feeling attached. Instead, positive self-talk is effective when it's believed deeply, and a part of a full-body practice.</p> 
</section>
<section id="ember115" > 
<p>For effective positive self-talk training:</p> 
<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong >Start by listing some things that you truly feel good about, and/or things that you've been successful with as you work towards your goals.</strong></p> 
<p>Focus on what's going well, even if that's very small. Write out your list and keep it handy. Add to it when you can—once you start looking for good things, you'll see them more often.</p> 
<p><strong >Next, set a reminder in your calendar or on your cellphone.</strong>&nbsp;For 2 minutes each session, morning and night, practice some positive self-talk.</p> 
<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong >When you do your self-talk, pick 1 or 2 items from the list.</strong>&nbsp;Sit with those things. Think about how they make you feel good—and feel accomplished.</p> 
<p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong >Clearly visualize yourself doing something you're proud of.</strong>&nbsp;Remind yourself of that awesome moment, and make it as real as possible—like making a movie of that experience in your head. Try to recollect that experience in as much detail as you can.</p> 
<p>Changing patterns of thinking takes practice, probably over years. Be patient. Respect and appreciate yourself and what you're capable of.</p>
