<p><b>Why to practice eating healthy fats regularly.</b></p> 
<p>People used to think dietary fat made you fat, slow, and heart attack-y.</p> 
<p>But, if you’re focusing on the right kind and quantity of fats,&nbsp;<b>healthy fats are necessary to being strong, fit, and healthy.</b></p> 
<p>Healthy fats:</p> 
<ul type=disc> 
<li >help you recover faster;</li> 
<li >nourish fatty tissues like your brain, eyes, and cell membranes;</li> 
<li >help you absorb fat-soluble vitamins, like Vitamin A, D, and K; and</li> 
<li >keep your muscle-building and sexytime hormones revving.</li> 
</ul> 
<p>Believe it or not, healthy fats can actually help you lose fat. (Sounds insane! It’s true!).</p> 
<p>If you get enough of these important fats, your hormones stay healthy, you keep kicking ass in the gym (and the bedroom), and you stay smart and happy.</p> 
<p>(Plus your skin looks diviiiiine.)</p> 
<p>And let’s be honest: Fat makes food taste real good.</p>

<p><b>Work with your yourself</b></p> 
<p>As all new nutrition skills are, this is a game and an experiment. Try stuff and see what works for you. Play with it and — if the time is right — challenge yourself.</p> 
<p><b>To keep it simple</b>, try to get just one or more of the healthy fat sources at most meals. One serving is about one thumb. That could translate to about a small handful of nuts, a tablespoon of olive oil on your salad, or a small scoop of guacamole.</p> 
<p><b>When you get consistency down</b>, look for variety. Be adventurous. (For instance, try different kinds of nuts, or crack open a coconut at home.)</p>
