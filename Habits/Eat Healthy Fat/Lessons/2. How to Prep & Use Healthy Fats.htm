<h1 align=center >How to Prep &amp; Use Healthy Fats</h1>
<h2 align=center >Here are some ways to incorporate healthy fats into your daily menu.</h2>
<form >
<h1 >
<section id="ember132" >Incorporate healthy fats into your regular daily menu.</h1>
<p>For a healthy fats grocery shopping list, here are a few common sources:</p>
<ul type=disc >
<li ><strong >Oils</strong> such as olive, coconut, flax seed, hemp seed, canola, algae, etc.</li>
<li ><strong >Butter</strong></li>
<li ><strong >Olives</strong></li>
<li ><strong >Avocado</strong> or guacamole</li>
<li ><strong >Nuts</strong> such as almonds, Brazil, cashews, pecans, pistachios, walnuts, etc.</li>
<li ><strong >Nut butters</strong> such as almond, cashew, etc.</li>
<li ><strong >Peanuts</strong> and natural peanut butter</li>
<li ><strong >Seeds</strong> such as chia, ground flax, pumpkin, sunflower, hemp, etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>Of course, other foods have some healthy fats (especially whole eggs, fish, dairy, and meats). The foods above are the healthy-fat superstars.</p>
<p>Most fats keep pretty well in the fridge or cupboard, so you can easily buy in bulk and keep them handy. And unlike proteins or most veggies, most fats tend to come ready-to-eat.</p>
<p>Here are some ways you could get healthy fats into your regular meals.</p>
<p><strong >A healthy baseline serving size to start with is 1 thumb per meal.</strong></p>

<h1 >Breakfast ideas</h1>
<ul type=disc >

<ul type=disc >
<li >Sprinkle a few walnuts, almonds, ground flax, chia seeds, hemp seeds, fresh coconut (or coconut milk), or nut butter into a protein shake.</li>
