<p>Coach's Notes:&nbsp;Feedback is just information that you can use to gather data to do outcome-based decision making. There is no such thing as &quot;failure&quot;.</p>

<h1 >Feedback is just information.</h1> 
<p>Imagine walking on a rocky surface — maybe a beach, or a dry creek bed, or a hiking trail.</p> 
<p>Some of the stones are stable and solid. If you step on them, they don’t move.</p> 
<p>Some of the stones are slippery. Maybe there’s a little algae on them, or some mud.</p> 
<p>Some of the stones aren’t stable. They wiggle or tip when you step on them.</p> 
<p>With every step you take, you are getting feedback about the path. And you can use that immediate feedback to correct course as needed.</p> 
<p>If you step on a rock, and it shifts, did you fail?</p> 
<p>No.</p> 
<p>You just got important information about the next thing to do — try another rock.</p> 
<p><strong >You got feedback.</strong></p> 
<p>It's data that you can use to make a decision.</p> 
<p>When you walk on rocks, you get feedback. The physical sensation of whatever the rock is doing — sliding, tipping, or staying steady — tells you what you should do next.</p> 
<p>Same as with all your other movements, whether in the gym or outside of it. If you feel yourself leaning too much to one side, or losing your grip on a weight, or losing your balance, you take action to correct that.</p> 
<p>Same as with your eating habits. If you notice that red-light foods seem to make you overeat, or make you feel sick, then you make a decision about whether to keep those foods around.</p> 
</section>
<section id="ember111" > 
<h1 >Over time, you build a database from your feedback.</h1> 
<p>If you walk that rocky trail often enough, you might start to learn which rocks to avoid or step on.</p> 
<p>If you do your exercise or sport movements often enough, you learn which movements are tricky or harder to do properly. And you figure out some ways to anticipate and/or change that.</p> 
<p>If you get red-light-food indigestion often enough, you’ll probably try to learn which foods trigger the gut churn.</p> 
<p><strong >It’s all just information.</strong></p> 
</section>
<section id="ember112" > 
<h1 >And, failure's not real.</h1> 
<p>If you stumbled on that rocky path, you got feedback about an untrustworthy rock. You didn’t fail walking.</p> 
<p>If you fell down in the gym, you got feedback about leaning too far to the left. You didn’t fail exercise.</p> 
<p>If you ate suicide chili hot wings and spent the evening trying unsuccessfully to digest a fireball, you got feedback about what foods work for you, or don’t. You didn’t fail eating.</p> 
<p><strong >No matter what happens, you don’t fail.</strong></p> 
<p>In those moments, you just made a choice that didn’t work — but that gave you important information anyway.</p> 
</section>
<section id="ember113" > 
<h1 >Change your perspective.</h1> 
<p><strong >Today, be curious about feedback.</strong></p> 
<p>Look at the choices you make, and notice what happens when you make them.</p> 
<p>What information did you get? What insight? What data?</p> 
<p>What does that feedback tell you about what you could do next, or change?</p> 
<p>Or keep the same? Or do less/more of?</p> 
<p>What happens when you do X? What happens when you do Y? What about Z?</p> 
<p>Try getting rid of the words “good” or “bad” and substitute “interesting” or “useful”, as in: “Well, that’s interesting” or “That’s useful to know”.</p> 
<p>Treat it like a game.</p> 
<p>What could you discover?</p>
