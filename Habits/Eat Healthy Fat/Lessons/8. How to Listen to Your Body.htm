<p>Coach's Notes:&nbsp;What does &quot;listening to your body&quot; mean? Here are some physical indicators that you can observe.</p> 
<form > 
<h1 >
<section id="ember116" >Tune in and see what you find.</h1> 
<p>What should I do?</p> 
<p>Oh, just listen to your body.</p> 
<p><strong >Seriously?</strong></p> 
<p>What does that even mean? Listen to your body?</p> 
<p><strong >Bodies obviously don’t talk in words.</strong></p> 
<p>They do talk in older, more primal signals.</p> 
<p>Pain or pleasure. Feeling hot or cold. Energy levels. Movement. Health or illness. Mood. Digestion.</p> 
<p>Sometimes those signals are loud and clear, like when you stub your toe and your body yells&nbsp;<em >“Aaaaaaahhhh, that really freaking hurt!”</em>&nbsp;with an immediate stab of pain.</p> 
<p>Or when you get the stomach flu, complete with jackhammering headache and projectile everything.</p> 
<p>Other times those signals are a little hazier, or we don’t pay as much attention to the subtle signals.</p> 
<p>Here are a few ways you can tune in to what your body may be telling you to do.</p> 
</section>
<section id="ember117" > 
<h1 >Set the stage for paying attention.</h1> 
<p>While you can listen to your body any time, any where, it helps when you don’t have other distractions.</p> 
<p>The next time you’re somewhere quiet, take a moment.</p> 
<p>Focus your attention over your body from head to toe.</p> 
<p>Go body part by body part, with a brief scan.</p> 
<p>During that 30 seconds you’re scanning, see what you notice.</p> 
<p>Here are some things to look for.</p> 
</section>
<section id="ember118" > 
<h1 >Pain</h1> 
<ul type=disc > 
<li >Right now, does anything hurt?</li> 
<li >If so: Where? How?</li> 
<li >What is the pain like? Achey? Stinging? Sharp? Diffuse? Etc.</li> 
</ul> 
</section>
<section id="ember119" > 
<h1 >Attention, calm and focus</h1> 
<ul type=disc > 
<li >Right now, do you feel calm and relaxed, like you’re in a good comfy spot? Like you can chill out and focus?</li> 
<li >Or do you feel jumpy, restless, fidgety, or irritable? Maybe distracted and scattered? Ants in your pants?</li> 
<li >How’s your breathing right now?</li> 
</ul> 
</section>
<section id="ember120" > 
<h1 >Energy levels and fatigue</h1> 
<ul type=disc > 
<li >Right now, do you feel full of zest, mojo and vigor, ready to grab the world and sucker-punch any obstacles in your way?</li> 
<li >Do you feel draggy or blah? Or even downright exhausted?</li> 
<li >Are you sleepy or alert? Craving caffeine or happily unwinding?</li> 
<li >How did you sleep last night? How many hours? Was it a good quality sleep?</li> 
</ul> 
</section>
<section id="ember121" > 
<h1 >Mobility and muscle tension</h1> 
<ul type=disc > 
<li >Are your joints feeling flexible, limber and supple?</li> 
<li >How well can you get around and do the things you want to do?</li> 
<li >Anything creaking, crunching, aching or restricted?</li> 
<li >Anything feeling especially tense or relaxed?</li> 
</ul> 
</section>
<section id="ember122" > 
<h1 >Appetite, hunger and digestion</h1> 
<ul type=disc > 
<li >Are you hungry or full? How do you know?</li> 
<li >Are you craving anything or do you feel like eating?</li> 
<li >How’s your digestion today? Everything humming along?</li> 
</ul> 
</section>
<section id="ember123" > 
<h1 >Mood, emotions, and overall outlook</h1> 
<ul type=disc > 
<li >How would you describe your emotional state right now? For example, it could be joyful, happy, enthusiastic … or sad, angry, or shameful.</li> 
<li >What about your mood? Regardless of specific emotions, are you feeling generally positive or negative?</li> 
<li >Or your overall outlook on life?</li> 
</ul> 
</section>
<section id="ember124" > 
<h1 >Don’t judge; just gather data.</h1> 
<p>Whatever you notice, just let it be. Don’t try to change or fix it.</p> 
<p>All you’re doing is gathering data. Just observing.</p> 
<p>Getting that feedback. Tuning in.</p> 
<p><strong >There are no morals in data.</strong></p> 
<p><strong >It’s not “good” or “bad”. It's just information.</strong></p>
