<p><b>The Benefits of Omega-3s</b></p> 
<p>All about the incredible, edible, health-promoting omega-3s.</p> 
<p>Coach's Notes:&nbsp;What omega-3s are and why they're healthy.</p> 
<div > 
<p>Top of Form</p> 
</div> 
<p><b>What are omega-3 fats?</b></p> 
<p>Omega-3 fats are a type of healthy fat found exclusively in:</p> 
<ul type=disc> 
<li ><b>a few types of nuts and seeds</b>, such as flax seeds, chia seeds, walnuts, and hemp;</li> 
<li ><b>marine life</b>, such as cold water fish, shellfish, and algae.</li> 
</ul> 
<p>Omega-3 fatty acids in fish and algae are what help keep their cold-water bodies from freezing.</p> 
<p>Because they stay liquid at low temperatures, omega-3s are like natural antifreeze.</p> 
<p>Cool... (literally :)</p> 
<p><b>There are three important forms of omega-3 fats:</b></p> 
<ul type=disc> 
<li >ALA (alpha-linolenic acid)</li> 
<li >DHA (docosahexaenoic acid)</li> 
<li >EPA (eicosapentaenoic acid)</li> 
</ul> 
<p><b>ALA</b></p> 
<p>Most plant-based sources (e.g. flax, walnuts, and chia) are rich in ALA.</p> 
<p><b>EPA/DHA</b></p> 
<p>Marine sources (such as fish and algae) are rich in EPA and DHA.</p> 
<p>Our bodies mostly use DHA/EPA, which comes almost exclusively from marine life.</p> 
<p>ALA can be converted in the body to DHA/EPA, but most people convert it very inefficiently. So, it’s hard to get enough DHA/EPA from plant sources like flax seeds, and marine sources are essential for balancing fats.</p> 
<p><b>Why are omega-3 fats good?</b></p> 
<p>Omega-3 fats do all kinds of awesome things for the body.</p> 
<p>For instance, they can:</p> 
<ul type=disc> 
<li >keep our hearts and brains healthy;</li> 
<li >lower inflammation;</li> 
<li >improve our cells' communication;</li> 
<li >keep joints mobile;</li> 
<li >help us stay lean; and</li> 
<li >help build muscle.</li> 
</ul> 
<p>There is strong evidence that omega-3s can:</p> 
<ul type=disc> 
<li >improve your blood lipids (like triglycerides and HDL-C);</li> 
<li >help reduce some symptoms of depression and anxiety;</li> 
<li >help reduce some ADHD symptoms; and</li> 
<li >help regulate our metabolism and blood sugar.</li> 
</ul> 
<p>And other evidence, though not as strong, for:</p> 
<ul type=disc> 
<li >preventing cancer;</li> 
<li >preserving memory;</li> 
<li >improving eye health; and</li> 
<li >decreasing liver fat.</li> 
</ul> 
<p><b>Fats: Your body’s signal system.</b></p> 
<p>Not all fat we eat gets stored on our bellies and butts.</p> 
<p>Our bodies like to use healthy fats to do other important things, like:</p> 
<ul type=disc> 
<li ><b>make fat-based tissues</b>, like our brains and the fatty sheath that insulates our spinal cord and nerves;</li> 
<li ><b>make many hormones</b>, such as testosterone and estrogen; and</li> 
<li ><b>make the membranes</b>&nbsp;for all our cells.</li> 
</ul> 
<p>The fat we consume becomes an essential part of every one of our cells.</p> 
<p><b>Fat can powerfully influence how our cells communicate and interact.</b></p> 
<p>For example, fat can affect signaling molecules that influence blood vessel constriction, inflammation, blood clotting, pain, airway constriction, etc.</p> 
<p>Since our brains are fat-based, changes in fat composition can affect how nerve impulses are transmitted.</p> 
<p>This can affect our moods, how well we think, our overall mental health, and even our brain’s longevity.</p> 
<p>And, omega-3s may be some of the most powerful and important fats for our bodies.</p> 
<p><b>Should you supplement with omega-3 fats?</b></p> 
<p>The answer to this question depends on you.</p> 
<p>If you’re just starting to get the hang of healthy fats:</p> 
<p><b>Keep it simple.</b></p> 
<p>Focus on getting a range of healthy fats from whole foods such as nuts, seeds, avocados, etc.</p> 
<p>And if you like fish, try bringing it into your life more regularly: A little sushi here, a little smoked salmon there... it adds up (and tastes good).</p> 
<p>If you’re doing those general basics consistently,</p> 
<p><b>Consider adjusting your omega-3 fat intake.</b></p> 
<p>Do you consistently eat fatty cold-water fish like salmon, mackerel, herring, or sardines two to three times per week?</p> 
<p>Our guess: If you don’t live in Japan, Crete, Scandinavia, some other coastal fishing village, or up in the Arctic where you’re hunting your own seal and whale to eat, it’s probably a challenge.</p> 
<p>If you’re not regularly eating fatty fish, then&nbsp;<b>consider omega-3 supplementation</b>.</p> 
<p><b>Fish oil</b></p> 
<p>Supplement daily with 3–6 grams of total fish oil, giving you around 1–2 grams of total EPA+DHA.</p> 
<p>This dose is high enough to give you all the health benefits listed above, while also being very safe.</p> 
<p><b>Krill/algae oil</b></p> 
<p>You can also supplement with krill oil or algae oil, which is plant-based marine life.</p> 
<p>With these products, use smaller doses: Aim for 300 mg of total EPA+DHA from these.</p> 
<p>While eating plenty of flax seeds, chia seeds, and walnuts, and maybe taking a little flax oil can all be healthy things, they don’t replace eating or supplementing with EPA and DHA from marine life.</p>
