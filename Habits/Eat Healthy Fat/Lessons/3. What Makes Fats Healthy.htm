<p><b>What Makes Fats Healthy?</b></p>
<p>The healthy fat continuum.</p>
<div >
<p>Top of Form</p>
</div>
<p><b>Why are healthy fats so good for us?</b></p>
<p>Healthy fats are:</p>
<ul type=disc>
<li ><b>naturally occurring</b> (such as the fat in olives, nuts and seeds);</li>
<li ><b>relatively minimally processed</b> (either they’re whole foods, or they’ve been simply pressed or ground).</li>
</ul>
<p>These are the kinds of fats that keep your hormones healthy, your brain happy and smart, your fatty tissues (such as your eyes and skin) well-lubed, and your body chemistry working smoothly.</p>
<p>When you eat healthy fats, you feel good, perform well, and recover easily.</p>
<p>Plus stuff tastes really good. (Avocado, nut butter, and coconut! And a little bit of dark chocolate... yessssss)</p>

<p>Your friend, the walnut. Pick and eat.</p>
<p><b>What makes other fats unhealthy?</b></p>
<p>Unhealthy fats tend to increase inflammation, risk of heart disease and cancer, and other undesireable things.</p>
<p>What makes these particular fats “unhealthy”?</p>
<p>Unlike healthy fats, you’ll notice that these unhealthy fats:</p>
<ul type=disc>
<li ><b>don’t naturally occur</b> in the foods they’re found in; and</li>
<li ><b>have to be created through an industrial process.</b></li>
</ul>
<p><b>Trans fats</b></p>
<p>Trans fats are created in an industrial process that forces hydrogens into vegetable/seed oils, which makes them more solid. Food manufacturers mainly use the process to lengthen a product’s shelf life. Solid fat is more stable on the shelf.</p>
<p><b>Look for the terms <i>partially hydrogenated</i> or <i>vegetable shortening</i>.</b></p>
<p>These tell you that there are trans fats in the product, even if the product lists 0 g of trans fats per serving.</p>
<p>Those sneaky devils are allowed to do so if the serving contains less than 0.5 g.</p>
<p>You can also look for <i>mono</i> and <i>diglycerides</i> on the label, which are other processed (less-healthy) forms of fat.</p>
<p>Many packaged and storable foods contain a lot of trans fats, including:</p>
<ul type=disc>
<li >margarine or processed oils, such as cooking spray;</li>
<li >regular peanut butter;</li>
<li >fried or battered foods;</li>
<li >pie crust and other baked goods; and</li>
<li >frozen dinners and other processed foods.</li>
</ul>
<p>Some foods, such as dairy and beef, contain naturally occurring trans fats. These naturally occurring trans fats don’t seem to be a problem, and some research suggests they may actually be good for us.</p>
<p>(Again, notice how when fats naturally occur in food, they are usually healthy.)</p>
<p><b>There is no amount of industrial trans fat consumption that is recognized as safe.</b></p>
<p><b>Do your best to minimize your intake.</b> (if it’s a work in progress, that’s okay.)</p>
<p><b>Industrial vegetable/seed oils</b></p>
<p>Then, there are other kinds of oils that we can only create with industrial processing.</p>
<p>These oils include:</p>
<ul type=disc>
<li >corn;</li>
<li >cottonseed;</li>
<li >safflower;</li>
<li >soybean; and</li>
<li >sunflower.</li>
</ul>
<p>These oils undergo a lot of processing to actually become edible: High heat and harsh chemicals (such as bleaches, solvents, and deodorizers) strip them of many nutrients.</p>
<p>Because of the heat and processing these oils undergo, they can have significant amounts of trans fats in them.</p>
<p>Many foods are made with these industrial</p>
<ul type=disc>
<li >vegetable/seed oils, including:</li>
<li >commercial salad dressing;</li>
<li >commercial mayonnaise;</li>
<li >butter substitutes;</li>
<li >fried and battered foods; and</li>
<li >most processed foods.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Important</b>: These are categorizations of “healthy” and “less healthy” foods.</p>
<p><b>There’s no such thing as absolutely “good” and “bad” foods.</b></p>
<p><b>You don’t have to eliminate trans fats or vegetable/seed oils entirely.</b></p>
<p>Having some restaurant salad dressing or regular peanut butter on occasion won’t kill you. <b>It’s making informed choices and what you do <i>consistently</i> that matters.</b></p>
<p><b>Level up: Balancing your fats</b></p>
<p><b>If you’re consistently getting some healthy fats at most meals, consider dialing-in the details: balance your fat intake between saturated, monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats.</b></p>
<p>The healthiest mix is about a 1-1-1 balance. That mix will keep inflammation balanced, and all brain and body cells talking to each other nicely.</p>

<p>That level of detail could seem intimidating at first. Make it easy for yourself by building a roster of convenient go-to foods within each category.</p>
