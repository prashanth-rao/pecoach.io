<p><strong >What’s your secret?</strong></p> 
<p>Does it seem like “everyone else” in health and fitness knows something you don’t?</p> 
<p>Does it feel like “everyone else” is eating better? Or doing all their workouts? Or dropping pounds of fat like rats leaping off a sinking ship?</p> 
<p>Are you convinced that “everyone else” sails on through their days, avoiding chocolate fudge cake like it’s a plate of dog poop?</p> 
<p>Does it feel like you are doing, feeling, or thinking something just a little bit… embarrassing? Foolish? Shameful? Weird?</p> 
<p>Maybe yesterday, you ate a bowl of Frosted Flakes… for dinner.</p> 
<p>Do you feel like you’re letting down your coach when you don’t always make smart carb choices, or when you miss a protein serving?</p> 
<p>Everyone else is in the same boat. Everyone is living on the same planet, following the same physiological rules and dealing with relatively similar mental, emotional, and physical stressors.</p>

<h1 >The problem with secrets</h1> 
<p>Secrets are nagging. They keep gnawing and nibbling on your soul.</p> 
<p>Secrets make us feel alone and isolated.</p> 
<p>In coaching, secrets hurt your health and fitness because they can actually push you to make worse choices.</p> 
<p>If you feel bad about eating a piece of cake, the resulting guilt and shame may encourage you to say “oh $&amp;#! it!” and eat more.</p> 
<p>If you are having trouble with a few exercises and feel too embarrassed to ask for help, you might eventually avoid the gym altogether.</p> 
<p>If you constantly worry about “making a mistake” or “letting the team down”, all your energy goes to rigid self-control… and when the self-control hatch blows — look out!</p> 
<p>If you have a “foolish” or “unrealistic” dream — say, climbing Mt. Everest — and constantly focus on why you can’t or&nbsp;<em >shouldn’t</em>&nbsp;want to try that, then you probably won’t even try getting close. You might not even try to climb a local hill because why bother?</p>

<section id="ember115" > 
<h1 >Come out of the closet.</h1> 
<p>Healthy nutrition and deep health is a path you walk for life. It’s a daily practice and a process. It’s a way to self-knowledge.</p> 
<p>Deep health isn’t perfection or groupthink. It’s not a badge you have to wear forevermore.</p> 
<p><strong >If you’re sitting on a secret</strong>&nbsp;… come out of the nutrition closet.</p> 
</section>
<section id="ember116" > 
<p>Tell your truth. Get real with yourself.</p> 
<p>Whatever it is, it’s not so bad.</p> 
<p>And once the “secret” is out… you’ll feel much better. You’re human. You’re a work in progress, just like everyone else.</p>
