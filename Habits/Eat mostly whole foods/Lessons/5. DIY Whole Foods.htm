<h1 >The secret about cooking</h1> 
<p>Here is a super-secret truth about cooking:&nbsp;<strong >Most cooking is easy.</strong></p> 
<p>Seriously. Even the fancy stuff.</p> 
<p>Yes, if you want to do Julia-Child-style authentic French cooking, it can be time-consuming and fiddly. But, every cooking task can be broken down into simple steps, and made easy. Even kids can learn to cook.</p> 
<p>If you're a reasonably intelligent adult who has access to fire, can hold a spoon, and can follow a recipe, you can cook about 98% of anything in the world.</p> 
<p>All learning takes trial and error. Even the best chefs have plenty of burned pots, inedible swamp mushes, or carbonized bricks in their history. There will be discarded food mistakes in the process. Don't get discouraged. Learn and keep trying.</p>

<li >a blender and/or food processor</li> 
<li >good cookware</li> 
<li >a good knife or two</li> 
<li >utensils</li> 
<li >a cutting board</li>
