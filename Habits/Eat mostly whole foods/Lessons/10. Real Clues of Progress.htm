<p><b>Real Clues of Progress</b></p> 
<p>Get ready to love your mirror!</p> 
<p>Coach's Notes:&nbsp;The illusion of physique (i.e. looking lean is not the same as having a low scale weight), and presenting oneself well in terms of appearance.</p>

<p><b>Progress comes in all shades, shapes, and styles.</b></p> 
<p>Big progress goes beyond numeric losses on the tape measure or scale. Real, dig-deep, gut-level, meaningful progress. Deep heath progress.</p> 
<p>It's common for people to sign up for coaching thinking they want to lose weight or get in shape. Then, along the way, start to realize that those original goals are really about other things.</p> 
<p>Things like fun. Excitement. Confidence. Being the boss of their lives. Authentic relationships.&nbsp;<b>Joy.</b></p> 
<p>As they shed fat and unveil sleek, powerful muscles, they also realize that looking good is not about a scale weight, body fat percentage, or clothing size.</p> 
<p>It's really about how they present and express themselves to the world.</p> 
<p><b>The illusion of physique</b></p> 
<p>Remember this optical illusion?</p>

<p>The middle line there is the same length. The endpoints are different. This makes the middle line look different.</p> 
<p>Body change works in a similar way. Often, when you're eating right and training hard, things change shape or just look better.</p> 
<p>For instance, your skin glows and your facial features become more defined. Your waist looks narrower in relation to wider shoulders. Your arms may be more shapely. Your butt is bouncin' and behavin'.</p> 
<p>More importantly, you feel different inside. Which you project outward. You stand up straighter and walk with confidence. You look people in the eye. You smile.</p> 
<p>Below are two examples of fitness progress:</p>

<p>Yes, they've both gotten smaller and more toned. What's even&nbsp;<i>more</i>&nbsp;noticeable is the change in&nbsp;<i>personality</i>—the smile, confidence, joyful self-presentation. These people are ready to kick the world in the ass.</p> 
<p>The people around you typically aren't going to ask you to step on a scale, or whip out a measuring tape to check your neck size (unless you're at the tailor's).</p> 
<p>Instead, people notice how you carry yourself, and what you project into the world. Those are the stronger cues that the people around you will respond to, and you may be treated differently accordingly. You may treat yourself differently accordingly.</p> 
<p>That's what having a good physique is all about. Not a scale number. Not an inch marker on a measuring tape.</p> 
<p><b>Think about what you're projecting into the world.</b></p> 
<p>What message are you sending to others about what you're worth? About how you feel? About how you're choosing to live a healthy, vibrant lifestyle? Here's one way to start practicing more physical confidence.</p> 
<p><b>You've got it. Flaunt it!</b></p> 
<p>Everyone has their own unique style. What's yours? Find your unique style and flaunt it.</p> 
<p>What's unique to you will also likely be what feels the most effortless to express.</p> 
<p><b>Show it. Live proud of your unique style. And have fun with it!</b></p>
