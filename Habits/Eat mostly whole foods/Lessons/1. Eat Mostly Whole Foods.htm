<section id="ember107" >You decide what will move you up the whole foods continuum.</h1> 
<p>Whole foods include:</p> 
<ul type=disc > 
<li >vegetables</li> 
<li >fruits</li> 
<li >meats and poultry</li> 
<li >fish and seafood</li> 
<li >nuts and seeds</li> 
<li >beans and lentils</li> 
<li >whole intact grains</li> 
<li >minimally processed dairy (e.g., fresh plain yogurt)</li> 
</ul>

<section id="ember108" > 
<h1 >Experiment to move up the continuum</h1> 
<p>Try experimenting with some new whole foods. Have fun and use it as a way to step outside your comfort zone.</p> 
<p>You could try to...</p> 
<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong >Build your awareness of the difference between whole foods and processed foods.</strong></p> 
<p>In your opinion, what &quot;counts&quot; as whole foods? Why?</p> 
<p>See if you can notice your own thinking, feeling, and reasoning. Notice where and when you feel resistant to &quot;giving up&quot; processed foods.</p> 
<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong >Transition towards a &quot;mostly whole foods&quot; menu.</strong></p> 
<p>Try making some small changes, like taking a break from a few processed staples for awhile. Or, embrace the challenge of finding new whole-food recipes.</p> 
<p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp; Help yourself remember and execute.</p> 
<p>Give yourself a reminder and check it often.</p> 
<p>Stock up on delicious whole foods in the next few days so that choosing whole foods is simple and convenient.</p> 
<p>4.&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong >Build a whole foods environment.</strong></p> 
<p>What’s in your kitchen? What whole foods do you need to add? What processed foods need to go?</p> 
<p>Stock your kitchen, work space, or any other place that you can with convenient whole foods.</p>

<h1 ><em >You</em>&nbsp;decide what “mostly” is, according to your body, your life, and your goals.</h1> 
<p><strong >Play with that baseline to see what you can improve a little bit.</strong></p> 
<ul type=disc > 
<li >If you’re eating 50% whole foods now, try for 60%.</li> 
<li >If you’re eating 80% whole foods and love a challenge, shoot for 100% for two weeks.</li> 
<li >If you’re an astronaut, eat one of the little sprouts you’re growing in zero-G.</li>
