<section id="ember107" >What's changed for you recently?</h1> 
<p>Thinking back over the last few months, year, or couple of years, how are you a different person now than you used to be?</p> 
<p><strong >Do you move differently now</strong>&nbsp;than you used to?</p> 
<p><strong >Do you eat differently now?</strong></p> 
<p><strong >Do you tackle your challenges differently now?</strong></p> 
<p><strong >Do you feel different</strong>—maybe in a hard-to-define kinda way?</p> 
<p><strong >Do you not feel different at all?</strong>&nbsp;(Which is interesting too.)</p>

<section id="ember108" > 
<h1 >What's progress?</h1> 
<p>How do you define and measure &quot;change&quot;?</p> 
<p>If you want to improve your skill at making deliberate change, what do you need to do?</p> 
<p>To know how to measure progress, you'll have to start with a solid understanding of the fundamentals as a baseline.</p> 
<p>Fundamentals like:</p> 
<ul type=disc > 
<li ><strong >Who are you?</strong></li> 
<li ><strong >What's important to you?</strong></li> 
<li ><strong >What do you stand for?</strong></li> 
<li ><strong >Why are you doing this?</strong></li> 
</ul> 
<p>Then, you can be more specific in answering the question:</p> 
<ul type=disc > 
<li ><strong >How will you know youre making progress?</strong></li> 
</ul> 
</section>
<section id="ember109" > 
<h1 >Some examples, beyond the numbers</h1> 
<p>Of course, you can track your progress by looking at:</p> 
<ul type=disc > 
<li >your consistency with daily practices, nutrition and movement</li> 
<li >your measurements</li> 
<li >your photos</li> 
</ul> 
<p>You can look at a lot of other things too. For instance, reflecting back on change you've made recently:</p> 
<ul type=disc > 
<li ><strong >Are you doing the right things,&nbsp;</strong><em ><b>consistently</b></em><strong>, every day?</strong></li> 
<li ><strong >Are you focused on&nbsp;</strong><em ><b>meaningful</b></em><strong>&nbsp;actions—doing what truly matters?</strong>&nbsp;(Or are you feeling stuck in &quot;wondering and worrying&quot;?)</li> 
<li ><strong >Have you grown as a person?</strong>&nbsp;Have you &quot;stretched&quot; and challenged yourself mentally and emotionally?</li> 
<li ><strong >Have you developed new life skills?</strong></li> 
<li ><strong >Have you taken control of your life and responsibility for your actions?</strong></li> 
<li ><strong >Do you think proactively?</strong>&nbsp;Do you now anticipate, plan, and strategize?</li> 
<li ><strong >How is your daily-life movement quality?</strong>&nbsp;Are you pain free and mobile?</li> 
<li ><strong >Are you more physically confident?</strong>&nbsp;Willing to try new things—even if it means struggling or feeling silly? Do you walk tall?</li> 
</ul> 
<p>These things are intangible. Tough to measure. But they're there.</p> 
<p><strong >And they're just as important as—sometimes even more important than—getting leaner and fitter.</strong></p> 
<p>Think about how you're different now.</p> 
<p>What's changed? What's better?</p> 
<p>Why are those changes important to you?</p> 
<p>Think about it.</p>
