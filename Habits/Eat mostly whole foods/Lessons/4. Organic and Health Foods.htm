<section id="ember108" >Don't get fooled by tricky marketing. Healthy processed foods are still processed.</h1>
<p><strong >Knowing exactly what's in your food (or supplements) is important.</strong></p>
<p>Marketing and labels make it easy to focus on what seems &quot;healthy&quot; or &quot;wholesome&quot; about a processed food product, such as:</p>
<ul type=disc >
<li >the product's name (e.g., &quot;Taste of Nature&quot;, &quot;Mom's Home Recipe&quot;, &quot;XYZ Farm&quot;)</li>
<li >the product's packaging (e.g., bright colors or an earthy-looking brown paper package)</li>
<li >claims made on the front of the package (e.g., &quot;Helps lower cholesterol&quot; or &quot;A good source of fiber&quot;)</li>
<li >where the product is shelved and sold (e.g., in the &quot;health food&quot; aisle or in a health food store)</li>
</ul>
<p>But are those packaged, processed products really &quot;healthy&quot; and &quot;wholesome&quot;? Sadly, no.</p>
<p>In fact, plenty of &quot;healthy&quot; foods aren't much better than their conventional counterparts.</p>

<h1 >What does &quot;organic&quot; mean?</h1>
<p>Organic food is big business. Over $45 billion in big business in the US in 2019.</p>
<p>In the United States and Canada, &quot;organic&quot; covers the ways that crops, livestock, and agricultural products are raised, processed and handled.</p>
<li> Organic crops are raised without using most conventional pesticides, petroleum-based fertilizers, or sewage sludge-based fertilizers.</li>
<li> Animals raised on an organic operation must be fed organic feed, bred naturally, and get to go outdoors. They are not given antibiotics or growth hormones.</li>
<li> In Canada, organic standards prohibit factory-type farming. This means that organic farmers must minimize the animals' stress and not confine them in pens or cages that are too small.</li>
<p>Simply, &quot;organic&quot; means that the food was grown or raised without certain toxic chemicals like pesticides, fertilizers, antibiotics, or hormones.</p>
<p>With some room for error in the measuring and labeling...</p>
<ul type=disc >
<li >100% Organic or Organic: Contains 95% or more organic ingredients</li>
<li >Made With Organic Ingredients: Contains at least 70% organic ingredients</li>
<li >If the product has less than 70% organic ingredients, then only the ingredients that are organic can be called &quot;organic&quot;.</li>
</ul>
<p>While these labeling efforts are a positive step for transparency, <strong >this criteria doesn't mean that &quot;organic&quot; means &quot;healthy.&quot;</strong></p>
<p>An &quot;organic&quot; label tells us about the chemicals in the growing and handling processes that the food went through before getting to the store shelf. It doesn't have any claims to how the food will behave when it's eaten, or whether or not it's &quot;healthy&quot;.</p>
<p>For animal products, &quot;organic&quot; also has <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2019/1/30/18197688/organic-cage-free-wild-caught-certified-humane" target="_blank" >no claims to animal welfare practices</a>, like breeding, feeding, or the space allowed for the animals to move freely.</p>
<p><strong >An &quot;organic&quot; label alone doesn't guarantee that the food is safer or healthier, especially if it's a processed food product.</strong></p>

<section id="ember110" >
<h1 >The health food hustle</h1>
<p>Like organic food, &quot;health food&quot; and &quot;natural products&quot; are also big business.</p>
<p>(Oh, and by the way, the term &quot;natural&quot; on labels is meaningless. Don't be fooled by the marketers.)</p>
<p>Indeed, health food stores have come a long way since their humble beginnings as weird-smelling, cramped hippie outposts.</p>
<p>It's a lot easier now for consumers to buy healthier, organic, minimally processed foods, even at mainly conventional grocers <a href="https://www.thebalancesmb.com/organic-retailers-in-north-america-2011-2538129" target="_blank" >like WalMart and Kroger</a>.</p>
<p>This also means that there are a lot of companies introducing foods to &quot;compete&quot; in the natural and organic food space.</p>
<p>And, as each company adds their unique processing and marketing twist, we end up with a bunch of distracting processed foods that claim to be healthy... but, in substance, aren't any different than any other processed food out there.</p>

<h1 >When is organic better?</h1>
<p><strong >Be a critical consumer.</strong></p>
<p>First, choose whole, minimally processed foods. These will always have more health benefits than processed foods, whether organic or not.</p>
<p>Then, look to organic as a second filter. If you're willing to pay a little more for an organic alternative, you'll be taking a step to save yourself and the surrounding environment from added toxic chemicals.</p>
<p><strong >Be a smart—and skeptical—health food shopper! When in doubt, go minimally processed. That's usually the safest bet.</strong></p>
