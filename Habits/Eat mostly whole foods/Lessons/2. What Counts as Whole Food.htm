<p>What makes a <strong >whole food</strong>?</p>
<p>The whole foods checklist:</p>
<ul type=disc >
<li >You can recognize what whole foods used to be.</li>
<li >Whole foods don't come in any packaging, other than what's necessary to keep them from leaking or rolling around.</li>
<li >Whole foods typically don't have ingredient labels.</li>
<li >Whole foods take the minimum number of steps to get to you.</li>
<li >Most whole foods go bad fairly quickly.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong >Alternatively...</strong></p>
<p>The processed foods checklist:</p>
<ul type=disc >
<li >You generally can't recognize what processed foods used to be.</li>
<li >Processed foods come in packages such as bags or boxes.</li>
<li >Those bags or boxes have ingredient labels.</li>
<li >Processed foods take many steps to get to you.</li>
<li >Processed foods will keep for a long time.</li>
<li >Processed foods are easy to find at places that aren't grocery stores.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="ember116" >
<h1 >What counts as a &quot;whole food&quot;?</h1>
<p>Whole foods include:</p>
<ul type=disc >
<li >fresh vegetables</li>
<li >fresh fruits</li>
<li >fresh meats and poultry</li>
<li >fresh fish and seafood</li>
<li >nuts and seeds</li>
<li >beans and lentils</li>
<li >whole intact grains</li>
<li >minimally processed dairy (e.g. fresh plain yogurt)</li>
</ul>
<p>But what about stuff that's in between?</p>
<p>Maybe it comes in a bag or box or bottle, but it's still pretty close to what it used to be.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<ul type=disc >
<li >canned tomatoes</li>
<li >frozen peas</li>
<li >cold-pressed virgin oils</li>
<li >fresh juices—if they've been made right in front of you (pre-bottled ones don't count—they're still highly processed, even if they claim &quot;fresh-squeezed taste&quot;)</li>
<li >dried beans or lentils</li>
<li >coffee or tea</li>
</ul>
<p>To decide what counts for you, consider:</p>
<p>1. <strong >What are the ingredients?</strong></p>
<p>2. <strong >How many steps did this food take to get to me?</strong> (If you don't know, it's probably worth finding out.)</p>
<p><strong >If the answers are:</strong></p>
<p>o One or two things</p>
<p>o Not very many</p>
<p>...then you can call it a &quot;whole food&quot;.</p>
<p><strong >If the answers are:</strong></p>
<p>o Added, non-whole food ingredients</p>
<p>o Quite a few</p>
<p>...try to find an alternative option for these two weeks.</p>

<p>This is food that's going in to your body. Use your best judgment.</p>
<p>Or, alternatively… you could bend reality to argue that candy apples or caramel popcorn count as whole foods because you can recognize what they used to be. Your judgment, for your goals.</p>
<p>Notice and name your decision-making process.</p>

<h1 >What about eating on the road?</h1>
<p>One of the best &quot;travel food&quot; sources appears all over the industrialized world: a grocery store or market.</p>
<p>You won't always be able to buy fresh, local organic produce on the north coast of Scotland or in Nunavut, but you can usually score at least a few items that meet the whole foods criteria, such as a bag of baby carrots or an apple.</p>
<p>Especially if you're traveling…</p>
<p>1. Think ahead.</p>
<p>2. Anticipate, plan, strategize.</p>
<p>3. Stay creative.</p>
<p>4. Look for options and unfamiliar opportunities.</p>
<p>This is the way of the whole food warrior.</p>
</section>
<section id="ember120" >
<h1 >Build your own whole foods</h1>
<p>You could use this information to <strong >try a few new things</strong> and get creative with your menus for the next several days.</p>
<p>For instance:</p>
<ul type=disc >
<li >If you'd like to use flour for a recipe, try grinding it yourself. Use a coffee grinder and throw in some whole intact grains. This has the added benefit of letting you get creative—try wild rice or quinoa flour!</li>
<li >If you’d like to have tomato sauce, dump some tomatoes into the blender. Or try simply grating a fresh tomato on a grater, over a bowl.</li>
<li >If you want jam, cook up some fruit.</li>
<li >If you really want to go old-school, we dare you to make your own sausage. Hey, it was good enough for our Italian grandparents—it's good enough for you! (And it's a lot easier than you’d expect.)</li>
</ul>
<p>Figuring out how to transform whole foods into some of your familiar favorites helps build your cooking skills. It's a wholesome win-win.</p>
