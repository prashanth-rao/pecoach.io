<p><i>Life is what happens to you when you're busy making other plans.<br > —John Lennon</i></p>

<h1 >Life is a full-contact sport.</h1>
<p>There are no sideline-sitters. No benchwarmers. Life is a full-contact sport. It's full of twists and turns. Crises. Obstacles. Chaos.</p>
<p>You can't plan what will happen to you. All you can do is be responsible for your reaction to unexpected life events.</p>
</section>
<section id="ember117" >
<h1 >You can't control life.</h1>
<p>You can only control your behaviors and attitude.</p>
<p>Through all of the inevitable life events and crises...</p>
<p>Births. Deaths. New relationships. Breakups. Children arriving. Children leaving. Getting hired. Getting fired. Serious accidents and illnesses. Fires, floods, earthquakes, hurricanes, and other random acts of Nature's fury.</p>
<p>There's never a dull moment.</p>
<p>There are plenty of excuses for &quot;falling off the coaching wagon&quot;. Some excuses aren't very convincing. Others are justifiable.</p>
<p><strong >Through it all, there are folks who simply persevere. Endure.</strong></p>
<p>These people put their head down and do their best to keep slogging. They turn problems into learning opportunities and crises into enlightenment. They aren't always cheerful, but they're always committed to doing the right things—whatever they can do, every day.</p>
<p><strong >These are the &quot;endurance athletes&quot; of life.</strong></p>
<p>Through mud, rain, sleet, dark of night, and crises, they just keep trudging along. These folks had every reason to give up... and didn't.</p>

<h1 >What makes these folks so special?</h1>
<ul type=disc >
<li ><strong >They're committed to the program</strong>. They know to stick with the plan even when times are tough.</li>
<li ><strong >They trust getting people to help them</strong>. They know they aren't the experts in everything.</li>
<li ><strong >They stay positive and proactive</strong>, even when things suck.</li>
<li ><strong >They do the best they can with what they have</strong>. They don't try to be &quot;perfect&quot;. Just as good they can be on that day.</li>
<li ><strong >They keep checking in.</strong> Even if they can only spare a few seconds to touch base on their goals with themselves or with a coach, they do so.</li>
<li ><strong >They forgive themselves</strong>. They treat themselves with compassion and generosity. They recognize that it's not all-or-nothing. They know that sometimes, just staying in the same place while the world is pushing them backwards is a victory.</li>
<li ><strong >They treat problems as challenges to overcome and puzzles to solve</strong>, not opportunities to whine, withdraw, or curl into the fetal position. (They don't always love those problems, but they're committed to tackling them anyway.)</li>
<li ><strong >They fall down and get up</strong>. They focus on their successes, as tiny and hard-won as those successes may be. They forget failures and setbacks, except to learn from them.</li>
</ul>

<h1 >How can you run life's obstacle course better?</h1>
<p>These abilities aren't unique or exclusive to only a lucky few, of course. They're skills to be practiced and developed. You can learn and practice them too.</p>
<p>If you'd like to improve your resilience, practice. Pick one very small action to do every day to improve your &quot;obstacle course&quot; skills.</p>
<p>For instance:</p>
<li> <strong >Build resilience.</strong><br > Find some small annoyance once a day, and figure out how to &quot;bounce back&quot; from it immediately.</li>
<li> <strong >Learn to be proactive.</strong><br > Every morning, ask yourself, &quot;How can I take responsibility for one thing today?&quot; Then do it.</li>
<li> <strong >Anticipate, plan, strategize.</strong><br > Every evening, take 5 minutes to plan your next day so that you anticipate and strategize around one small potential problem.</li>
<li> <strong >Focus and re-focus on doing the things that </strong><em ><b>truly</b></em><strong> matter, every day, </strong><em ><b>consistently.</b></em><br > Book time to check your lessons, do your habits, and get your workouts done to the best of your ability.</li>
<li> <strong >Re-frame problems as opportunities to learn and practice your skills.</strong><br > Think about the challenges you currently face. What skills have you already been building to tackle those challenges?</li>
<li> <strong >Ask for help.</strong><br > Once a day, take a few minutes to connect with someone in your support network, even if that's just someone who will gently remind you that things will be OK.</li>
<li> <strong >Play in the mud.</strong><br > When possible, treat challenges as games. Get dirty.</li>
<p>Running life's obstacle course is a skill you can learn. It takes 3 Ps: Practice, Perseverance, and a bit of Playfulness.</p>
