<section id="ember113" >Leaders inspire us to be better. How can you become a leader?</h1>
<p>What is a leader? Humans have asked this question for millennia.</p>
<p>A leader isn’t someone who dominates with bluster and force. A leader isn’t a bully nor a boss. A leader isn’t necessarily the loudest voice in the choir.</p>
<p><strong ><i>A leader is—quite simply—someone who inspires others to be better.</i></strong></p>
<p>Leaders show us the path, often by stumbling along it themselves.</p>

<h1 >What makes a leader?</h1>
<p>Lots of things.</p>
<ul type=disc >
<li >Leaders take action. Decisively. Consistently.</li>
<li >Leaders help others. They know that success is not a finite pool, and they pull others up as they climb.</li>
<li >Leaders aren't trying to be anyone other than themselves—their best selves. They don't fret about &quot;following the herd&quot; or measuring up to some imaginary ideal. They keep it real.</li>
<li >Leaders stay focused. They don't get distracted by &quot;wonder and worry&quot;.</li>
<li >Leaders see the big picture. They don't get bogged down in small daily details. They keep forging ahead, one habit and action at a time.</li>
<li >Leaders focus on behaviors, not outcomes, and help others do the same. Leaders know that the quality of the journey—for everyone—is what truly matters.</li>
<li >Leaders live with integrity. They live their values and principles, honestly and authentically. They don't say one thing and do something else.</li>
<li >Leaders lead by learning. They're not afraid to make mistakes or fall down—even in front of other people. They suck it up, dust themselves off, and keep marching forward.</li>
</ul>

<p>Some leaders are born. But most are made through experience and practice.</p>
<p><strong >If you want to develop your own leadership abilities, start acting like a leader in small daily ways.</strong></p>
<p>For a new daily practice, pick one characteristic of a leader from the list, and make it into a concrete daily practice that you can do right now, today, and every day until you get the hang of it. Once you've mastered that first step, add another leadership practice.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<ul type=disc >
<li >Write yourself a few post-it notes with reminders for whatever you're currently working on.</li>
<li >Stick those notes up where you'll see them several times daily.</li>
<li >Schedule a &quot;focusing ritual&quot; once a day, or during your workout, where you review your key priorities, and resolve to stay on track with them.</li>
<li >Do a &quot;distraction makeover&quot;. Try to get rid of anything in your environment that distracts you from focusing on your goal.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong >Leadership is built out of purposeful, meaningful actions</strong>, done consistently over a long time.</p>
