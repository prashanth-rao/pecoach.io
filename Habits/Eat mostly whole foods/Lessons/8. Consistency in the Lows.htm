<section id="ember107" >Is your consistency high but scale needle not budging?</h1> 
<p>Some days, it feels like you're spinning your wheels. The harder you mash down that gas pedal, the more your tires sink into the mud.</p> 
<p>You're stuck.</p> 
<p>But are you?</p> 
<p>Really?</p> 
<p>From experts' research and experience compiled from hundreds of thousands of clients, we know:&nbsp;<em ><b>Consistency</b></em><strong>&nbsp;equals success.</strong></p> 
<p>Well, it equals success most of the time.</p> 
<p>There are inevitably a few folks who kick butt in the gym and the kitchen, stick to the coaching program, stay positive and proactive... but don't seem to transform their bodies dramatically.</p> 
<p>This can happen for many reasons.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some clients are&nbsp;<strong >close to their goal already</strong>. They might already be pretty fit and healthy, so their progress is quiet and slow.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some clients&nbsp;<strong >aren뭪 in coaching to change their outsides</strong>뾲hey want to learn to improve their eating practices and get a program with structure. For them, &quot;success&quot; is not measured with a tape measure or calipers, but by life changes.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some clients have&nbsp;<strong >health situations</strong>, or are on medications, that make it extra-hard to lose fat, gain muscle, and/or get much fitter.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some clients are&nbsp;<strong >as consistent as they can be... with limitations</strong>. Perhaps they're injured and can't exercise as intensely or as often as they'd like. Perhaps they뭨e working long alternating shifts in a high-stress job뾲hey fit in workouts and proper eating wherever they can, but there's only so much you can do when you pull an all-nighter on a busy ambulance route or in an emergency ward.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some clients are so new to the process of healthy eating and regular exercise that they need&nbsp;<strong >a little extra time to practice</strong>. For them, ticking off &quot;80% full&quot; might mean they're actually learning to eat to &quot;100% full&quot; (instead of 150%).</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some clients are simply looking at the wrong indicators of progress. They may be staying the same weight and girth, but replacing fat with muscle (which is why using photos as an additional progress measure is useful).</p> 
</section>
<section id="ember108" > 
<p>Whatever the reason, these few folks are nailing high consistency, but not seeing the numbers change. This, too, is a valiant battle.</p> 
<p>It's hard to stay motivated and committed without these numeric rewards.</p> 
<p>For this reason, we salute and recognize the &quot;high consistency&quot; today뾣olks who are working hard, staying focused on their goals, and remaining enthusiastic even when the scale needle doesn't budge.</p>

<h1 >Your consistency is high and you're movin' on.</h1> 
<p>If you're in the &quot;high consistency/low numeric change&quot; category, some advice:</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong >Focus on the quality of the process</strong>. Keep acting in meaningful, purposeful ways, every day. Stay focused on doing the right things.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong >Focus on other indicators of progress</strong>. You may be making tremendous progress in other ways.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong >Keep a close record of what you're doing and eating</strong>. Periodically review it, analyze it, and look for any patterns or things that are tripping you up. (Remember this is just data for scientific examination, not a judge of your goodness or badness.)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong >Consider whether you can bump up your consistency by pushing yourself a little</strong>. Are you truly eating to 80% full? Could you work a little harder in the gym? Are you truly challenging yourself, enough to feel uncomfortable?</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong >Consider whether you may actually need to work less</strong>. Some clients aren't getting results because they뭨e beating themselves into the ground. If you're starving yourself and doing three hours of cardio a day along with a high-stress job, you may want to rethink your strategy.</p> 
<p>Breathe. Stay calm and carry on.</p>
