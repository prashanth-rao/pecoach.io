<p>Coach's Notes:&nbsp;The benefits of less processed foods.</p>

<section id="ember108" >Learning to eat well isn't just about taking away &quot;bad stuff&quot;.</h1> 
<p>It's really about adding more good stuff.</p> 
<p>Stuff that gives you more bang for the buck. More value. More nourishment.</p> 
<p><strong >Your food should actively enhance your health.</strong></p> 
<p>Your food should make your body run better. And every morsel you eat should earn its rent. No freeloaders!</p> 
<p>You have only limited stomach space. Why waste that valuable chewing time and gastrointestinal real estate on foods that don't help you get healthier and leaner?</p>

<h1 >Nutrient density</h1> 
<p>Whole foods are &quot;better&quot; because:</p> 
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong >Whole foods contain nature's medicine cabinet</strong>—a host of chemicals and compounds that promote health.</p> 
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong >Whole foods usually contain these chemicals and compounds in a form that we absorb and digest</strong>—not a formula cooked up in a lab, which may be chemically similar but not absorbed and used as well by our bodies. Nature usually does a pretty awesome job at putting stuff together for us in ways that our bodies recognize.</p> 
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong >Whole food nutrient combinations make them more useful</strong>—nutrient combinations work together, not in isolation. You often need substance A to absorb or digest substance B. And often, A and B are in the same food. It's like the food evolved to be that way or something.</p> 
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong >Whole foods contain these chemicals and compounds in the proportions that are appropriate</strong>—we aren't overdosing on one vitamin or mineral from a pill.</p> 
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong >Whole foods have the maximum nutrition possible</strong>—especially if those foods are fresh, seasonal, and local. Whole foods are closest to their original form, before nutrients are stripped away through time and harsh processing.</p> 
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong >Whole foods match our hunger and fullness cues better.</strong>&nbsp;Because of the reasons above, whole foods work more seamlessly with body signaling. We're able to stop when we've had enough.</p> 
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong >Once your taste buds adapt, whole foods generally taste better</strong>—compare a fresh, in-season, just-picked strawberry to a &quot;strawberry&quot; milkshake. The flavors are more complex and nuanced. If you're eating slowly and mindfully, whole fresh food tastes good, while highly processed, chemical-laden food… doesn't.</p> 
<p>Conversely, processed/refined foods:</p> 
<ul type=disc > 
<li >have their nutrients stripped away;</li> 
<li >require an industrial process that often includes harsh chemicals such as solvents, deodorizers, and bleaches; are &quot;fortified&quot; with chemical analogues of the nutrients that were removed—because otherwise, the food would have almost no nutritional value at all;</li> 
<li >are substances that we didn't evolve to digest, absorb, or tolerate well;</li> 
<li >generally contain lots of sugar, fake fats, sodium, and other industrial additives;</li> 
<li >can play havoc with our natural appetite, hunger, and satiety signals— it's really easy to overeat processed foods.</li> 
</ul> 
<p>Let's compare.</p>

<h1 >What's in your food?</h1> 
<p><strong >Whole foods also contain dozens—often hundreds—of compounds with health benefits.</strong></p> 
<p>Colorful veggies and fruit are particularly rich in these.</p> 
<p>For instance:</p> 
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong >Beta-cryptoxanthin</strong>, which is found in fresh papaya, mango, peaches, oranges, tangerines, bell peppers, and watermelon, can stimulate bone growth (and slow bone breakdown) and reduce your risk of osteoporosis, cancer and rheumatoid arthritis.</p> 
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You can find&nbsp;<strong >cyanodin</strong>&nbsp;in dark-colored berries, such as blackberries, blueberries, and raspberries, as well as in red-skinned fruits, such as apples and plums. Cyanodins are powerful antioxidants that may help prevent cancer and cardiovascular disease; they're also anti-inflammatory and anti-diabetic.</p> 
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Raw cacao beans and unrefined dark chocolate contain&nbsp;<strong >theobromine</strong>, which can lower blood pressure, relax the airways (it can even work as cough medicine), and make you feel groovy. (Milk chocolate—which is mostly sugar and filler—has only a trace of theobromine.)</p> 
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Two eggs will give you a great shot of&nbsp;<strong >choline</strong>, which you need to make your brain (including your moods) work properly. Since the choline is in the yolk, prepackaged egg white alone won't do the job.</p> 
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Animal-based&nbsp;<strong >conjugated linoleum acid (CLA)</strong>, a type of fatty acid found in the meat and milk of grass-fed ruminants, such as cows and sheep (as well as kangaroos!), may help you get and stay leaner.</p> 
<p>Many of these compounds are destroyed, removed, or chemically altered into unusable forms by processing.</p> 
<p><strong >Supplementing them won't do you much good</strong>, because the compounds are fragile and break down easily—you have to get them from whole food sources.</p> 
<p><strong >Simplicity is a reward of whole foods.</strong>&nbsp;The details of nutrient specifics can get dense and overwhelming.</p> 
<p>If you're eating whole foods, you don't need to remember all the specifics of nutrients. Eating a variety of whole foods everyday will take care of most of the body's needs, with no need for nerding on the chemistry.</p> 
<p>In any case, there are so many amazing medicines in nature's pharmacology, we don't even know what half these chemicals do yet!</p>

<h1 >Whole foods get digestion working harder</h1> 
<p>Here's one more interesting piece of the puzzle: Whole foods require more energy to digest, which is a good thing.</p> 
<p>A study compared whole food and processed food meals by comparing two very different cheese sandwiches.</p> 
<p>The whole food sandwich was made with multi-grain bread and cheddar cheese. The processed food sandwich was made of white bread and processed cheese.</p> 
<p>Same macronutrient ratio (percentage of protein, carbohydrates, and fat). Same nutrient calories. Same beautiful sandwich arrangement. So, same thing... right? No.</p> 
<p>When researchers compared people's metabolic rates after the meals, they found that eaters spent&nbsp;<strong >50% less energy</strong>&nbsp;digesting the processed sandwich.</p> 
<p>Those calories have to go somewhere. If fewer calories are burned in digestion, more calories are absorbed and stored in the body.&nbsp;<strong >More calories absorbed and stored adds up to more weight gain for people who eat a lot of processed foods.</strong></p> 
<p>On the other hand, the higher energy burned in digesting whole, unprocessed foods means that fewer net calories are stored as fat. While the total calories eaten between whole and processed foods can look like they match, whole food will have lower weight-gaining effects.</p> 
<p>Make your food earn its rent. Don't give it a free ride!</p> 
<p><strong >Whole foods deliver more of what you want, and less of what you don't.</strong></p>
