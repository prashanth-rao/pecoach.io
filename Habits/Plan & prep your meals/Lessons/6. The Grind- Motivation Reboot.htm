<section id="ember115" >What's different?</h1>
<p>Take a moment to pause and reflect on where you’ve come throughout your change and coaching journey. What’s changed since when started? Or 3 years ago? 5 years ago?</p>
<ul type=disc >
<li >Has your <strong >identity</strong> changed?</li>
<li >Have your <strong >values</strong> changed?</li>
<li >Has your <strong >definition of “progress”</strong> changed?</li>
<li >Have your <strong >daily routines</strong> changed?</li>
<li >Has your <strong >body</strong> changed?</li>
</ul>
<p>There are no right or wrong answers to these.</p>
<p>Maybe you've noticed the numbers just don't thrill you as much as they used to.</p>
<p>Of course, it’s always nice to see the scale needle go down if you want to lose weight. Or slide another weight plate onto the barbell.</p>
<p>Yet, maybe now the numbers lack a certain <em >je ne sais quoi</em>. Maybe they don't get you out of bed in the morning.</p>
<p>That’s normal.</p>

<h1 >Welcome to The Grind</h1>
<p>You may be in the phase of The Grind.</p>
<p>You discover that while you feel better from sticking to healthier practices, losing a few pounds or having a better bench press hasn’t magically changed your life.</p>
<p>Sure, you’re doing all the right stuff. Eating your vegetables. Planning your meals. Getting your exercise.</p>
<p>But when you enter The Grind you realize: Now you have to do these things over and over and over again. Ho hum.</p>

<h1 >The Grind is good</h1>
<p>It's not the sexiest stage of change, but The Grind is good.</p>
<p>The Grind gives us time to think. Time to evaluate. Time to practice.</p>
<p>In The Grind, we don’t have to think as much about setting-up systems, new routines, or how we’re going to do things.</p>
<p>We know by now how to get to the gym, how to pack those containers with our protein and veggies, how to tie our running shoes, how to cook broccoli, how to click “Yes” on daily healthy practices.</p>
<p>That frees up some space in our brains to think about the <em >why</em>.</p>
<p>So while it might seem like The Grind is a time of boredom or struggle, it’s actually a time of <em >incubation, practice, and mastery</em>.</p>
<p>While you do your daily practices, your new, fitter, leaner self is growing stronger.</p>
<p><strong >You have time to reflect on who you've become, and what you really want right now.</strong></p>
</section>
<section id="ember119" >
<h1 >What's YOUR new why?</h1>
<p>Today, <strong >think about </strong><em ><b>why</b></em><strong> you want to continue with the change you're seeking.</strong></p>
<ul type=disc >
<li ><strong >What is important to you?</strong></li>
<li ><strong >What is meaningful?</strong></li>
<li ><strong >What keeps you engaged?</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>If you feel like you’ve lost your way or can’t remember why the heck you started this, don’t worry.</p>
