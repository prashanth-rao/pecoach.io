<section id="ember112" >Plan ahead and keep moving, road warrior.</h1>
<p>When something is important to your health, mood, and well-being, do it every day.</p>
<p>Would you stop brushing your teeth while on vacation?</p>
<p>Same goes for exercise while traveling.</p>
</section>
<section id="ember113" >
<h1 >Find an excuse</h1>
<p>Most of us can find excuses not to work out. Try the opposite challenge: Find an excuse to work out.</p>
<p><em >&quot;Hey—anyone want coffee? I'm going to run down to that cool little place a few blocks over.&quot;</em></p>
<p><em >&quot;I'll pack the car. Give me all those heavy suitcases.&quot;</em></p>
<p><em >&quot;I don't like the arrangement of this hotel room. I think I'll push the table over here. And maybe flip the mattress a few times.&quot;</em></p>
<p><em >&quot;We have an hour before Activity X starts. I'm going to go get some fresh air and visit Attraction Y while I'm in town.&quot;</em></p>
<p>Think about it ...</p>
<p>You're already carrying something heavy.</p>
<p>You're already moving somewhere else, usually quickly.</p>
<p>You're already climbing stairs, walking around, or hauling stuff.</p>
<p>Sounds suspiciously like a workout ...</p>

<h1 >Moving on the road: Anticipate, plan, strategize.</h1>
<p>Unless your travel plans involve Liam Neeson and an unexpected international vacation in the back of an un-marked van, most of the time you'll know where you're going and when. You'll probably have a general sense of what you'll be doing.</p>
<p>Perfect.</p>
<p>That's all you need to start planning ahead before you go. Bust out the Googles and get to work.</p>
</section>
<section id="ember115" >
<h1 >Find movement opportunities.</h1>
<p>Find a hotel with a decent gym. Or look for nearby gyms. Many hotels have partnered with local fitness facilities and can offer you a reduced day rate.</p>
<p>Look for other activity-based attractions near you: parks, walking or cycling trails, etc.</p>
<p>Find things you can use for equipment—a tree branch or railing for pull-ups or rows, a bench to jump on, a hill or set of stairs to run up . . . you're only limited by your imagination.</p>
</section>
<section id="ember116" >
<h1 >Find social connections.</h1>
<p>Check <a href="https://www.meetup.com/" target="_blank" >Meetup.com</a> for specific activities.</p>
<p>Ask your buddies via social media if anyone's visited the area and can make recommendations.</p>
<p>Try being a &quot;fitness tourist&quot;. Is there someone you've always wanted to train with, or something you've wanted to do (e.g. hike Mount X, visit <a href="https://www.westside-barbell.com/" target="_blank" >Westside Barbell</a>, or swing some kettle bells at the <a href="http://www.icechamber.com/" target="_blank" >Ice Chamber</a>)? Now's the time!</p>
</section>
<section id="ember117" >
<h1 >Find time.</h1>
<p>Carve out time from your itinerary in advance (if possible) for your workout.</p>
<p>Especially if you're traveling on business, nobody will give you that time. You have to take it.</p>
<p>And look for ways to add short bursts of activity to your schedule. It all adds up.</p>
</section>
<section id="ember118" >
<h1 >Find your inner kid.</h1>
<p>We're often very serious when we travel, even if it's for vacation. Find ways to play. Run on the beach. Swing on the swing set between pull-ups. Whatever it is, just get moving.</p>
</section>
<section id="ember119" >
<h1 >Get creative; get moving</h1>
<p>Even if it's not perfect, you can always do something.</p>
<p>Keep it simple. Do the best you can with what you have. Have fun.</p>
