<section id="ember114" >Act first, get motivated later.</h1>
<p><strong >There are three big lies about exercise and good nutrition.</strong></p>
<p><strong >Lie #1: You have to be “inspired”</strong> to do practice healthy habits.</p>
<p><strong >Lie #2: You should always be “motivated”</strong> to practice.</p>
<p><strong >Lie #3: “Experts” are always motivated</strong> to practice.</p>
<p>Nope.</p>
<p>Even for healthy-lifestyle pros, <strong >there’s no such thing as permanent motivation</strong>.</p>
<p><strong >You will </strong><em ><b>not</b></em><strong> always be “motivated” or “inspired”.</strong> You will not always feel “flow”.</p>
<p>Motivation comes and goes. Some days that motivation will be totally MIA.</p>
<p>But that doesn’t matter.</p>
<p><strong >You don’t </strong><em ><b>need</b></em><strong> motivation nor inspiration to have good habits.</strong></p>
<p>In fact, what differentiates an “expert” from an “amateur” is not motivation . . . but action. “Experts” hunker down and find ways to get the job done, regardless of how they feel.</p>

<section id="ember115" >
<h1 >Action before motivation</h1>
<p>We assume that motivation and inspiration — in other words, a particular mental state — come before action.</p>
<p>Sometimes that’s true. Most of the time, it’s not.</p>
<p><strong >Action usually comes before motivation and that desired mental state.</strong></p>
<p>For instance, let’s say one day you decide to go for a walk. You’re not really <em >inspired</em> per se, but your brain feels fuzzy and you want some fresh air.</p>
<p>At first, you just sort of clump along, staring at the ground.</p>
<p>After 5 or 10 minutes, the brisk breeze starts to clear the cobwebs. You stand taller and breathe more deeply. Your stride lengthens and your hips loosen up. Now you’re walking proud. You have direction.</p>
<p>The movement is actually <em >giving</em> you energy.</p>
<p>After 20–30 minutes, you finish that walk on a high.</p>
<p>Your brain fuzz is gone, replaced by crystal-clear thoughts. Your body is energized. You feel re-engaged with life and the universe.</p>
<p>Now you’ve found that motivated mental state.</p>
<p>What changed?</p>
<p><strong >You </strong><em ><b>acted first</b></em><strong>.</strong></p>

<h1 >The 3 “Ss”</h1>
<p>Motivation and inspiration are like cats: They’re fickle in their affections, and they tend to disappear when you want them around.</p>
<p><strong >You can’t depend on cats. Nor can you depend on motivation and inspiration.</strong></p>
<p>Instead, you can depend instead on the 3 Ss:</p>
<ul type=disc >
<li ><strong >structure</strong></li>
<li ><strong >systems</strong></li>
<li ><strong >scheduling</strong></li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="ember117" >
<h1 >Structure</h1>
<p>Structures are the things and environments that surround us, and the things we put in place to ensure that things get done.</p>
<p>For instance:</p>
<ul type=disc >
<li >Have a daily or weekly routine that helps you stay organized.</li>
<li >Look for a gym that is convenient and on your way home from work.</li>
<li >Make sure your kitchen is full of healthy food.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong >What needs to be around you in order support your goals? How can you make your structure easier for yourself?</strong></p>
<p><strong >Then build those structures.</strong></p>
</section>
<section id="ember118" >
<h1 >Systems</h1>
<p>Systems are the processes and practices we use to make things happen.</p>
<p>For instance:</p>
<ul type=disc >
<li >Have an evening ritual of packing your gym clothes.</li>
<li >Or have a morning ritual of making your food for the day.</li>
<li >Start your workout with the mobility warm-up routine that prepares you to move comfortably and effectively.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong >What needs to happen for you to be effective? What processes and practices need to be in place?</strong></p>
<p><strong >Then create and do those things.</strong></p>
</section>
<section id="ember119" >
<h1 >Scheduling</h1>
<p>You don’t just wait for the morning when you feel like going to the dentist. You book an appointment.</p>
<p>Likewise, we don’t just wait till inspiration strikes — we book a time to hit the gym. We know that at 5 p.m. on Monday, we should be pumping some iron or pounding out the miles at the track.</p>
<p><strong >Book your fitness and nutrition just like you book any other appointment.</strong></p>
<p>Make it a time priority, put it into your calendar, and stick to it.</p>
