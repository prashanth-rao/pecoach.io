<section id="ember119" >Being away from home doesn't have to mean a vacation from healthy eating.</h1>
<p>You're on a family vacation and stop at a small café for dinner.</p>
<p>You're meeting clients downtown for lunch.</p>
<p>You're grabbing a quick bite with some friends before you head back home.</p>
<p>The situation may change. But the question stays the same: What are you going to eat?</p>
</section>
<section id="ember120" >
<h1 >Yes, you <em >can</em> eat well on the go.</h1>
<p>A few simple techniques can keep you on track and making good food decisions when you’re away from home.</p>
</section>
<section id="ember121" >
<h1 >Plan and prep strategies for restaurant meals</h1>
<p><strong >If you can, pick a healthy restaurant.</strong></p>
<p>With some creativity, you can do well almost anywhere.</p>
<p>Make your life easy and try to avoid the worst case scenario emergencies: Fast food chains and gas stations.</p>
<p>Instead, plan ahead to find restaurants that use fresh, local, and/or organic ingredients. If you don't have a lot of options, try finding a place with a salad bar.</p>
<p>If you live in the US, check out <a href="http://www.healthydiningfinder.com/home" target="_blank" >HealthyDiningFinder.com</a>. It'll suggest &quot;best case scenario&quot; options to you even at less-healthy restaurants, such as fast-food joints.</p>

<p><strong >Look for the &quot;Magic 3&quot;</strong></p>
<p>Once you're sitting down with your menu, look for the &quot;Magic 3&quot; choices:</p>
<ul type=disc >
<li >Vegetables and fruits</li>
<li >Lean protein</li>
<li >High-fiber, slow-digesting carbs such as beans or whole grains</li>
</ul>
<p>Skip anything that has the words &quot;fried&quot;, &quot;cheesy&quot;, &quot;crispy&quot;, &quot;glazed&quot;, or &quot;secret blend&quot;.</p>

<p>And try simply adjusting the proportions of veggies to starches. One golden phrase to use:</p>
<p><em >&quot;Can I get some extra vegetables with that? I’m willing to pay a little more if need be.&quot;</em></p>
<p>This is almost never a problem, though it may cost you an extra couple of bucks. Consider this your healthy living tax.</p>
<p><strong >Know what you're ordering. (In other words, ask.)</strong></p>
<p>You can’t always trust the menu. You can ask the server exactly what you're ordering.</p>
<ul type=disc >
<li ><em >How are the vegetables cooked? Any chance I could get them steamed?</em></li>
<li ><em >Could you serve the dressings/sauces/condiments on the side?</em></li>
<li ><em >Could you tell me if the chicken is breaded or grilled?</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Though they may seem nit-picky, these simple questions can save you from eating hundreds of unwanted calories, and stuff like added sugar or sodium.</p>
<p>If you ask politely, with a smile and no food-fascist overtones, you'll usually get a polite response in return.</p>

<h1 >Working with &quot;food saboteurs&quot;</h1>
<p>Well-meaning friends, family members, co-workers, or clients might try to bump you off track.</p>
<li> Most of the time, they're not even aware they're doing it:</li>
<p><em >&quot;Just try some of these cheesy chocolate marshmallow nut squares with extra sprinkles! You'll love them.&quot;</em></p>
<p><em >&quot;Here, take the rest of this stuffed-crust pizza. I don't want it to go to waste.&quot;</em></p>
<li> Other times, they're downright confrontational:</li>
<p><em >&quot;Why are you avoiding Food X? That's stupid.&quot;</em></p>
<li> Whatever the case, don't let them get to you. Simply let them know what YOU need, and where YOUR boundaries are.</li>
<p><em >&quot;No thanks, I'm cool with my meal. But thanks for the offer!&quot;</em></p>
<p><em >&quot;Those nachos look great, but I'll pass this time around. Thanks anyway.&quot;</em></p>
<li> If these approaches don't work, and your companion keeps pressing the issue, you can try a more direct approach:</li>
<p><em >&quot;Can I ask you something? Why is it so important to you that I eat these foods?&quot;</em></p>
<p>That will either get you off the hook or, in the case of a loved one, open up a meaningful discussion.</p>
<p>Whatever method you choose, remember that <strong >the only person's actions you can control are your own.</strong></p>
<p>You can't control what a dining companion thinks, does, or says. You can only control what you think, do, or say.</p>
<p>So, even if you're with companions who are pushing your buttons, keep it together.</p>
<p><strong >Stick to your priorities, remember what you need to be your best self, and gently but firmly reinforce your boundaries.</strong></p>
<p>We've got your back.</p>
