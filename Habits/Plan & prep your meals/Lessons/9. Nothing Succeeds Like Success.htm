<section id="ember113" >Take a few minutes to look back on what you've accomplished. Then keep going.</h1> 
<p>One really way to stay motivated is to review how well you’re doing with these three “Ss” in mind:</p> 
<ul type=disc > 
<li ><strong >satisfaction</strong></li> 
<li ><strong >success</strong></li> 
<li ><strong >strengths</strong></li> 
</ul> 
</section>
<section id="ember114" > 
<h1 >Satisfaction</h1> 
<p><strong >Make a quick list of all the things you’ve improved since starting with coaching.</strong></p> 
<p>For instance:</p> 
<ul type=disc > 
<li >Do you feel better now than you did on your first day?</li> 
<li >Do you walk taller, more confidently?</li> 
<li >Do you make better choices?</li> 
<li >Have you found your mojo?</li> 
<li >Are your clothes fitting better?</li> 
<li >Are you stronger?</li> 
</ul> 
<p>Review your list.</p> 
<p>Take a moment to feel good about each one of these things. You did that.</p> 
<p>To stay motivated, have practices of continually reviewing, recognizing, and rewarding progress.</p> 
<p><strong >Make your list of accomplishments.</strong></p> 
<p><strong >Give yourself props for what you’ve done so far. Feel satisfied. Feel proud.</strong></p> 
<p>Then use this list as inspiration to keep climbing.</p>

<section id="ember115" > 
<p>Yet satisfaction and pride in our accomplishments is essential.</p> 
<p>In order to stay motivated, we need to review, recognize, and reward progress.</p> 
<p><strong >Today, make your list of accomplishments.</strong></p> 
<p><strong >Give yourself a high-five for what you’ve done so far. Feel satisfied. Feel proud.</strong></p> 
<p>Then use this list as inspiration to keep climbing.</p>

<section id="ember116" > 
<h1 >Success</h1> 
<p>To succeed with healthy changes, you don’t have to be “special” or “genetically gifted” or “talented.”</p> 
<p><strong >You need to work hard, be consistent, stay positive, and just keep showing up.</strong></p> 
<p>While you’re still tackling your difficult challenges and fears, finding and address your limiting factors ...</p> 
<p><strong >Keep focusing mostly on what you’re doing right. On what you can do. Will do. Have, in fact, already done.</strong></p> 
<p>For example:</p> 
<ul type=disc > 
<li >If you’ve successfully made it to the gym 2 days a week for several months, that’s great! Now, let’s see if we can get you going one more day. After all, you’ve already managed your 2-day routine.</li> 
<li >If you’ve successfully cooked three new protein- and veggie-rich dishes, that’s great! Now we know you can follow a recipe — so let’s add two more.</li> 
<li >If you’ve lifted 50 pounds, that’s great! We now know that 60 pounds or 70 pounds — or maybe even 100 pounds — is just around the corner.</li> 
</ul> 
<p>Use your success as a foundation to build motivation.</p> 
<p>Nothing succeeds like success, as the saying goes.</p> 
<p><strong >In what ways have you succeeded so far?</strong></p> 
<p><strong >How can you help yourself do more of that?</strong></p> 
</section>
<section id="ember117" > 
<h1 >Strengths</h1> 
<p>If you’re like most people, working on addressing your &quot;weaknesses&quot;, &quot;flaws&quot;, and &quot;errors&quot; isn’t very inspiring.</p> 
<p><strong >Research shows that we do much better — and stay motivated — when we focus on the positive:</strong></p> 
<ul type=disc > 
<li >Identify what is working, and do more of that</li> 
<li >Find strengths, and figure out how to make them work for you</li> 
<li >Find people who are strong and successful in this area, and imitate them</li> 
</ul> 
<p><strong >When it comes to coaching, where are your strengths?</strong></p> 
<p><strong >How can you develop them even further?</strong></p>
