<h1 align=center >The Evolution of Eating</h1>
<h2 align=center >Ever wondered: What's a 'good' meal? Well, it depends on where you're starting.</h2>

<section id="ember153" >Ever wondered: What's a balanced meal? It depends on where you're starting.</h1>
<p><strong >Start with what you want and need.</strong></p>
<p>Imagine the kinds of meals that could work best for you right now—based on your lifestyle, your goals, your nutritional level, what you enjoy, etc.</p>
<p>Then, work backwards.</p>
<p><strong >What might you need to plan and prepare to make some of those balanced meals happen?</strong></p>
</section>
<section id="ember154" >
<h1 >Keep it simple</h1>
<p>Start with a handful of simple &quot;go-to&quot; meals that you like and can easily prepare.</p>
<p>Then, build out from there. Add a new meal at a time when you feel ready and want some variety.</p>
<p>Most importantly, whatever you make, enjoy it, savor slowly and mindfully, and eat to 80% full.</p>
</section>
<section id="ember155" >
<h1 >The continuum</h1>
<p>Food doesn't come with in-grown morals. There are no &quot;good&quot; or &quot;bad&quot; foods. Instead, we have a continuum of foods from &quot;better choices&quot; to &quot;worse choices&quot;; healthier to unhealthier.</p>
<p>&quot;Better choices&quot; have more nutrients, are eaten more mindfully and deliberately, and are selected with care and purpose to meet your goals.</p>
<p><strong >Each meal in the series below represents a different &quot;stage&quot; in an evolution from worse to better. They're examples of how meals could evolve over time and practice.</strong></p>
</section>
<section id="ember156" >
<h1 >What to look for in the evolution of meals</h1>
<p>As you look at the images and how the meals evolve gradually over time, notice:</p>
<ul type=disc >
<li >the foods that are chosen</li>
<li >the portion sizes</li>
<li >where and how they're eaten (e.g. by the computer, at a table, etc.)</li>
<li >how much care and attention goes into each meal (which meals seem more mindful or relaxed?)</li>
<li >how each meal is a small evolution from the previous one—not a huge leap</li>
</ul>
<p><strong >Where are your meals now on the continuum? Where could they be?</strong></p>
</section>
<section id="ember157" >
<h1 >Breakfast</h1>
<p><strong >Stage 1</strong></p>
<p>Once upon a time … you started your day with a whipped-cream coffee drink and a chocolate croissant. Maybe eaten in your car, on the go.</p>
<p>Where could you go from there over the course of a year?</p>
<p>Let's see . . .</p>
</section>
<section id="ember158" >
<div class='figure'><img src='https://prashanth-rao.github.io/pecoach.io/Resource/img/c8331801-facb-4833-be61-eb7fc7765a64.jpg' width=100%></div>
<p> </p>
<p><strong >Stage 2</strong></p>
<p>You could replace the croissant with a whole grain muffin. And the super-duper epic &quot;dessert in a cup&quot; with a regular coffee. Add a yogurt for a bit of protein.</p>
<p>Naturally, you're still rushed and busy . . . so you eat it with some distractions.</p>
</section>
<section id="ember160" >
<div class='figure'><img src='https://prashanth-rao.github.io/pecoach.io/Resource/img/5cc7f02c-83aa-46a5-b1f2-e18afcf2cc9c.jpg' width=100%></div>
<p> </p>
<p><strong >Stage 3</strong></p>
<p>Then, perhaps you decide to switch the muffin to granola with cottage cheese. Try black coffee (with a little sugar). And a couple servings of colorful fruit.</p>
<p>Of course, you're still checking out the news headlines while you eat . . .</p>
</section>
<section id="ember162" >
<div class='figure'><img src='https://prashanth-rao.github.io/pecoach.io/Resource/img/ee6b96f4-c98e-479b-b949-ed73e3f00f5b.jpg' width=100%></div>
<p> </p>
<p><strong >Stage 4</strong></p>
<p>Finally, maybe a year later, you're setting aside time to enjoy a leisurely breakfast of an egg frittata, which you prepped in advance on your food prep day.</p>
<p>The coffee's become green tea. The protein plus colorful fruit and veg have become the stars of the meal.</p>
<p>And you've discovered you really like lemon water.</p>
<p>You eat mindfully, feeling relaxed, while watching the sun rise.</p>
</section>
<section id="ember164" >
<div class='figure'><img src='https://prashanth-rao.github.io/pecoach.io/Resource/img/46833a28-a404-4eec-ad06-2d73f4866b81.jpg' width=100%></div>
<p> </p>
<h1 >Lunch</h1>
<p><strong >Stage 1</strong></p>
<p>&quot;Eat slowly? Are you sloth-people crazy?! Who has time for that during a busy workday?! Grab a burger and go!&quot;</p>
</section>
<section id="ember166" >
<div class='figure'><img src='https://prashanth-rao.github.io/pecoach.io/Resource/img/95313e82-9669-416f-a1d2-d0d3fbba308c.jpg' width=100%></div>
<p> </p>
<p><strong >Stage 2</strong></p>
<p>&quot;Fine, fine. I'll get a side salad with that burger, and maybe just a few potato chips, while I work on that report.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh yeah, and throw in a diet soda instead of regular.&quot;</p>
</section>
<section id="ember168" >
<div class='figure'><img src='https://prashanth-rao.github.io/pecoach.io/Resource/img/d552331b-407a-47a7-9bd8-1af9697303c1.jpg' width=100%></div>
<p> </p>
<p><strong >Stage 3</strong></p>
<p>&quot;Hey! You can make your own burger and it's pretty good! I whipped up the patties on my food prep day so I have them handy.</p>
<p>&quot;And I got some nice cheese and whole grain buns from the local market. Pretty darn good.&quot;</p>
</section>
<section id="ember170" >
<div class='figure'><img src='https://prashanth-rao.github.io/pecoach.io/Resource/img/1963c668-29ef-483c-8534-ca6871670a44.jpg' width=100%></div>
<p> </p>
<p><strong >Stage 4</strong></p>
<p>&quot;Let's do the burger with some veggies. And I'm going to sit, take my time, and enjoy this. I need a quiet break from the day.</p>
<p>&quot;What to drink? Oh, water's good.&quot;</p>
</section>
<section id="ember172" >
<div class='figure'><img src='https://prashanth-rao.github.io/pecoach.io/Resource/img/cc646c73-e5c5-4b82-a6f9-3e3cfa35e718.jpg' width=100%></div>
<h1 >Dinner</h1>
<p><strong >Stage 1</strong></p>
<p>It's 8 p.m. You just got home after an insane day at work. All you want to do is put food into your face and zone out in front of the TV.</p>
<p>You can't even imagine making anything more complicated than boxed macaroni 'n' cheese right now.</p>
<p>Ketchup and hot dogs will fancy this up.</p>
</section>
<section id="ember174" >
<div class='figure'><img src='https://prashanth-rao.github.io/pecoach.io/Resource/img/21c4c42b-e8fe-4291-8320-72f264dda6ef.jpg' width=100%></div>
<p> </p>
<p><strong >Stage 2</strong></p>
<p>Your protein's evolved to a rotisserie chicken leg that you grabbed at the grocery store on the way home.</p>
<p>You've added a side salad. And you're getting pretty good at cooking your own pasta.</p>
<p>Work is still on your mind, and a few drinks will take the edge off.</p>
</section>
<section id="ember176" >
<div class='figure'><img src='https://prashanth-rao.github.io/pecoach.io/Resource/img/7559195d-5e7e-479f-960d-efecbae3ef37.jpg' width=100%></div>
<p> </p>
<p><strong >Stage 3</strong></p>
<p>Protein and veggies are starting to find their way on to the scene.</p>
<p>You've cut the booze to 1 drink.</p>
<p>And you've banished the smartphone from the dinner table. (Hey! You're actually sitting at the dinner table!)</p>
</section>
<section id="ember178" >
<div class='figure'><img src='https://prashanth-rao.github.io/pecoach.io/Resource/img/9e58b1fa-3ac9-494d-bd57-b67a444f5415.jpg' width=100%></div>
<p> </p>
<p><strong >Stage 4</strong></p>
<p>With your meal planning and prep strategies, even a late-night dinner looks good.</p>
<p>You can whip up a delicious salad in 3 minutes flat and have some pre-cooked quinoa on hand.</p>
<p>That rotisserie chicken is still a fast, convenient option, but now it's got some healthy buddies.</p>
<p>The wine (you're indulging in the nicer stuff these days) is there for flavor now, rather than taking the edge off. 'Cause after a year of learning, listening, practicing, planning, prepping, and strategizing ... you're handling your stress like a champ!</p>

<div class='figure'><img src='https://prashanth-rao.github.io/pecoach.io/Resource/img/029d0e58-1f3c-4f43-a827-7b0dc231afea.jpg' width=100%></div>
<h1 >Be <em >just a little bit better</em></h1>
<p>Notice that the final image in each series is an ideal.</p>
<p>Most of us may never have all our meals look like that. And that's OK.</p>
<p>But . . . what if we tried going in that direction, slowly?</p>
<p>What if we tried to make just one meal a week like that ideal?</p>
<p>What if we tried to make our regular everyday meals just a little bit better, one step at a time (for instance, by sitting down at a table to eat)?</p>
<p>Well. That'd be pretty awesome.</p>
</section>
<section id="ember182" >
<h1 >Plan, prepare, strategize</h1>
<p><strong >This habit isn't about &quot;rules&quot; or &quot;eating on a schedule&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong >It's about being prepared.</strong> Healthy eating doesn't happen by accident.</p>
<p><strong >It's about feeling in control of your choices.</strong> Helping YOU learn what YOU need to succeed.</p>
<p><strong >It's about being just a little bit better</strong>, every day.</p>
<p><strong >It's about keeping it real</strong>. Enjoying what you love. And revising what's not working for you.</p>
