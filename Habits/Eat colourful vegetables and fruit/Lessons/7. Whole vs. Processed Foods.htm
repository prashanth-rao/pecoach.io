<p><b>Whole vs. Processed Foods</b></p> 
<p>Today, we'll explore the difference between whole and processed foods.</p>

<p><b>There's a big difference between whole and processed foods.</b></p> 
<p>Looking at common breakfast food packages, we might see things like:</p> 
<ul type=disc> 
<li >&quot;A good source of fiber&quot;</li> 
<li >&quot;Enriched with vitamins and minerals&quot;</li> 
<li >&quot;High in calcium”</li> 
<li >&quot;Contains 30% of the RDA for vitamin C&quot;</li> 
<li >&quot;Made with real fruit&quot;</li> 
<li >&quot;100% pure premium fruit juice&quot;</li> 
</ul> 
<p>Breakfast, for instance:</p> 
<div class='figure'><img src='D:\PE\Procoach\Nutrition\Resource\img\5308fb75-f8de-4724-97b6-cd092f8be11e.jpg' width=100%></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>That marketing looks exciting. What about the back of the package, for what's behind the marketing?</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><b>Whole vs. processed foods</b></p> 
<p>Here are two important nutrition principles:</p> 
<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Eat whole foods.</b></p> 
<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Avoid or minimize processed and refined foods.</b></p> 
<p>Okay, that makes sense. But why are whole foods better? And what happens when something is &quot;processed&quot; or &quot;refined&quot;?</p> 
<p>Great questions.</p> 
<p><b>Why does this matter?</b></p> 
<p>Generally, the more steps a food has to take to get to its final destination, the less healthy nutrition it contains.</p> 
<p>Fruits, vegetables, legumes, nuts, seeds, and whole grains have naturally occurring:</p> 
<ul type=disc> 
<li >vitamins</li> 
<li >minerals</li> 
<li >fiber</li> 
<li >protein</li> 
<li >good fats</li> 
<li >antioxidants</li> 
<li >beneficial phytonutrients (plant chemicals), such as the pigments that make strawberries red</li> 
</ul> 
<p>Processed foods have either been artificially produced without these naturally occurring nutrients, or they've had the nutrients stripped through processing.</p> 
<p>Nutrients are removed during processing with heat, solvents, additives, preservatives, bleaches, deodorizers, and other industrial chemicals. Any vitamins, minerals, fiber, and &quot;natural&quot; colors and flavors have to be added back in.</p> 
<p>Often, those artificial adds are a poor imitation of Nature's amazing complex, whole nutrition.</p> 
<p><b>Look at your next breakfast</b></p> 
<ul type=disc> 
<li ><b>Ask yourself</b>: How far has this food traveled to get to me?</li> 
<li ><b>Read the label</b>&nbsp;(if there is one). What does it contain? What was added to make it &quot;healthy&quot;? Do you know how it was created?</li>
