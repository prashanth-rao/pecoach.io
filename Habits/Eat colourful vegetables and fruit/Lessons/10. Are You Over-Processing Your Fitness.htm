<p><b>Are You Over-Processing Your Fitness?</b></p>
<p>Getting bogged down in details? Remember to keep exercise simple.</p>

<p><b>Whole vs. processed applies to fitness similarly as it applies to food.</b></p>
<p>It's easy to get overwhelmed with the sheer volume of information and advice in the media. Type &quot;exercise&quot; into Google and you'll get scorched with the information blast.</p>
<p>It can seem like there are so many things to remember. So many conflicting ideas. So many details!</p>
<p><b>Choose &quot;unprocessed exercise&quot;</b></p>
<p>Keep movement simple, &quot;unprocessed&quot;, and <b>fun</b>.</p>
<p>That means less &quot;wondering and worrying&quot; about things like:</p>
<ul type=disc>
<li >What if everyone is stronger than me?</li>
<li >I did 7 reps instead of 8. Did I waste my workout?</li>
<li >Am I going too slowly?</li>
<li >Is activity X better cardio than activity Y?</li>
<li >Should I be &quot;feeling the burn&quot; in my upper inner pecs when I do this?</li>
<li >What the heck are upper inner pecs anyway?</li>
</ul>
<p>Don't over-think. Don't over-analyze. <b>Just do.</b></p>
<p>Your body <i>already knows</i> how to move. It's been moving you since before you were born.</p>
<p>Don't worry about exact rep numbers, what So-and-So Internet Expert says, or which parts are sore the next day.</p>
<p><b>There is no Magic Workout Plan.</b></p>
<p><b>What's most important is that you <i>get moving</i> and <i>stay moving</i> as often, as diversely, and as intensely as you reasonably can.</b></p>
<p><b>What to focus on</b></p>
<ul type=disc>
<li ><b>Do the workouts in your plan.</b><br> Be consistent.</li>
<li ><b>Adhere as closely to the workout program as you can.</b> Adjust it as needed to accommodate your own fitness level, injuries, etc.</li>
<li ><b>Prioritize high-quality form.</b><br> Read instructions, watch the videos or teachers, and practice.</li>
<li ><b>Figure out what weight/resistance to use so you can complete the desired repetitions.</b><br> It doesn't matter if that weight is 20 pounds or 200 pounds. Use what works for <i>you</i>.</li>
<li ><b>Use the equipment you have available to you.</b><br> If you don't have the perfect setup, improvise.</li>
<li ><b>Stay active on your recovery days.</b><br> Do physical movements you enjoy, whether that's bowling, ballroom dancing, dodgeball, or competitive cup stacking.</li>
<li ><b>Go at your own pace.</b></li>
<li ><b>Do the best you can with what you have.</b></li>
<li ><b>Have fun!</b></li>
</ul>
<p>Your exercise is <i>your</i> time.</p>
<p><b>Check in with yourself</b></p>
<p>1. <b>Ask yourself: Am I over-processing my fitness?</b><br> Do a check for &quot;information overload&quot; and &quot;wondering and worrying&quot;.</p>
<p>2. <b>Get back to basics.</b><br> Focus on consistent, quality movement and putting in your best effort. Let the rest take care of itself.</p>
<p><b>Have fun!!</b></p>
