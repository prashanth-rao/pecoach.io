<section id="ember147" >The Men Who Made Us Fat and The Men Who Made Us Thin</h1> 
<p>These are BBC TV shows, so they're good for smaller bites (so to speak).</p> 
<p><a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b01k0fs0" target="_blank" >The Men Who Made Us Fat</a>&nbsp;looks at the food industry and how it creates extra-tasty, extra-appealing yet nutrient-poor products; as well as how changes in the last several decades have created an obesity-promoting environment. We're all marinating in it, and it's hard to resist.</p> 
<p><a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b038913v" target="_blank" >The Men Who Made Us Thin</a>&nbsp;are obviously high-fiving the Men Who Made Us Fat as they tag team on creating a weight-loss industry.</p> 
<p>Both investigative journalism programs explore how &quot;fatness&quot; and &quot;thinness&quot; aren't about &quot;willpower&quot; or &quot;character&quot;; they've both become industries with very real effects on average people.</p>
