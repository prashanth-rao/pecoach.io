<h1 >Who's your farmer?</h1>
<p>If you're already buying fresh, whole foods at your local grocery store, that's a great start.</p>
<p>If you found the picture quiz challenging, you could consider spending more quality time with your local farmer or Jamie Oliver.</p>
<p>Many common fresh foods we love travel a long, long way to get to us. Sometimes that can't be helped. Unless you live in western Africa or South America, you probably don't have coffee or cacao growing in nearby.</p>
<p>Other times, though, we do have fresh, local foods available. If you're lucky, you have the farmers' market.</p>

<p>Why shop at a farmers' market? Why buy seasonally? Why buy locally?</p>
</section>
<section id="ember134" >
<h1 >It's often cheaper</h1>
<p>Compared with the rest of the developed world, North Americans spend relatively less on their food. In part, because we don't often prioritize buying high-quality foods.</p>
<p>Luckily, when you buy in season, you can often get great high-quality foods for less, maybe <em >dirt</em> cheap (pun intended).</p>
</section>
<section id="ember135" >
<h1 >The quality is better</h1>
<p>Ever wonder why tomatoes in the supermarket in winter look and taste like pink softballs?</p>
<p>It's because they are genetically modified to be tough enough for mechanical picking. In other words, they're picked unripe, shipped thousands of miles, then artificially ripened using ethylene gas.</p>
<p>Now imagine picking a plump red tomato off the vine in late summer — it'll be juicy, sweet and delicious and bursting with valuable nutrients.</p>

<section id="ember136" >
<h1 >You support small family farmers</h1>
<p>Most farms in North America are small farms.</p>
<p>Most make less than $25,000 a year. In fact, in the US, the number of farms earning less than <em >$10,000</em> a year grew by 118,000 from 2002 to 2007.</p>
<p>Often, the folks who keep us fed find it difficult to put food on their <em >own</em> tables.</p>
<p><strong >Buying fresh, local food helps you get and stay lean and healthy by eating nutritiously.</strong></p>
<p><strong >It helps you get high quality, tasty foods.</strong></p>
<p><strong >And it helps your local community and economy.</strong></p>
<p>Win-win.</p>

<h1 >Start foraging</h1>
<p><strong >Do you have a local farmer's market?</strong></p>
<p>If you do... For a challenge, visit that farmers' market and purchase all the food you need for one day's worth of eating. Get fruits, veggies, lean meats, grains, eggs, or whatever fits into your plan.</p>
<p>Do your best to stock up on all locally grown stuff. No mangoes unless you live in Hawaii.</p>
