<section id="ember134" >While there are many ways to prepare and cook your veggies, here are four simple ones you can try this week.</p>

<section id="ember135" >
<h1 >1. Eat them raw</h1>
<p>You can always grab a carrot and start chomping away or pop grape tomatoes into your mouth like candy. But sometimes that gets a little boring. To dress up your raw veggies try the following.</p>
<p><strong >Add them to Super Shakes</strong></p>
<p>Super Shakes are great ways to get your veggies in when you're on the run. It's a great way to get a full serving or two of veggies without even thinking about it.</p>

<p><strong >Make an awesome salad</strong></p>
<p>Forget the bland iceberg lettuce and shredded carrots you've been served at Applebee's. Instead, take some pride in your salad and get creative.</p>
<p>Follow these steps for the perfect side salad.</p>
<p>1. Pick a &quot;soft&quot; leaf-like butterhead lettuce, spinach, or mixed greens.</p>
<p>2. Pick a &quot;crunchy&quot; leaf-like romaine lettuce or radicchio.</p>
<p>3. Pick a fresh herb like basil, dill, or parsley.</p>
<p>4. Pick a &quot;topping&quot; like sliced cucumber, tomato, carrots, celery, or bell pepper.</p>
<p>5. Pick a light dressing like olive oil and balsamic vinaigrette or make your own.</p>
<p>Chop it all up. Throw it together. Voilá!</p>

<p> </p>
<h1 >2. Eat them steamed</h1>
<p>This is another simple and quick method.</p>
<p>All you need is a big pot of water and a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000Q4N2LO/ref=s9_bbs_gw_d0_ir04?pf_rd_m=ATVPDKIKX0DER&amp;pf_rd_s=center-2&amp;pf_rd_r=1M475D4W9CZ42DHVGA3Q&amp;pf_rd_t=101&amp;pf_rd_p=470938631&amp;pf_rd_i=507846" target="_blank" >steamer basket</a> or a colander that will fit inside. Fill the pot with enough water so that it just barely reaches the bottom of the colander or steamer basket.</p>
<p>To steam your veggies, bring the water to a boil, add your vegetables, and place a loose-fitting lid on top to cover. (If your lid is more fitted over the colander, position it so that one side hangs over the colander just enough to let the steam escape.)</p>
<p>How long should you steam for? Well, it depends on the vegetable.</p>
<p>Broccoli: ~ 5 minutes</p>
<p>Brussels sprouts: ~ 10 minutes</p>
<p>Carrots: ~ 8 minutes (if sliced into 1&#8260;4&quot; thick pieces)</p>
<p>Cauliflower: ~ 6–7 minutes</p>
<p>Green beans: ~ 5 minutes</p>
<p>Peas: ~ 3 minutes</p>
<p>Zucchini: ~ 7 minutes</p>
<p>Tip: Try <em >undercooking</em> veggies slightly. You can always pop them back in to boil.</p>
<p>After steaming, try tossing your veg with a little olive oil plus a sprinkle of sea salt and black pepper. Or, if you're feeling rather daring, try some hot sauce or red pepper flakes.</p>

<p> </p>
<h1 >3. Eat them grilled</h1>
<p>Grilled veggies complement any meat dish perfectly and can even be a part of a delicious shish kabob with chicken, beef, or pork.</p>
<p>Brush them with the sauce of your choice, or a little olive oil. Sprinkle some salt or squeeze some lemon, and toss them on the grill or into the oven.</p>

<p> </p>
<h1 >4. Add them to soups and stews</h1>
<p>Sometimes you just gotta take a bunch of ingredients, throw them in a pot, and see what happens.</p>
<p>Creating a healthy, tasty soup or stew is easy, especially with a slow cooker. And if you're not the greatest chef, a soup or stew is one way to flex your culinary skills. It's just too simple to screw up!</p>

<h1 >The Sunday Ritual and food prep</h1>
<p>Successfully eating your fruits and vegetables comes down to making it easy, convenient, and available.</p>
<p>Try washing and cutting up some veggies in advance during your Sunday Ritual (or whenever you do your food prep). Or make a big pot of vegetable soup and refrigerate or freeze for later.</p>
<p>Remember, if it's ready and available, chances are, you'll probably eat it.</p>
