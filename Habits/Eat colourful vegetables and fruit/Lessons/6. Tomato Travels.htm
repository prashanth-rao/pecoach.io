<p><b>Tomato Travels</b></p>
<p>Our food doesn't just materialize on the supermarket shelves. So where does it come from?</p>

<p><b>Where does the food come from?</b></p>
<p>Consider the tomato.</p>
<div class='figure'><img src='https://prashanth-rao.github.io/pecoach.io/Resource/img/32c19869-a54c-4816-8bbe-a849f4d8de56.jpg' width=100%></div>

<p>Doesn't look all that exotic, does it? You can pretty much find tomatoes all over the world.</p>
<p>Still, the tomato is special. It can tell a story of a long food chain journey.</p>
<p>This tomato answers questions like:</p>
<ul type=disc>
<li >Where did you come from, tomato?</li>
<li >Who picked you?</li>
<li >What did they pick you from? (A tree? A vine? A shrub?)</li>
<li >How did you get to me?</li>
</ul>
<p>Maybe now you're now wondering:</p>
<ul type=disc>
<li >Why should I care? I'm trying to get lean, not take up farming!</li>
</ul>
<p>One reason you could care is that knowledge lends to appreciation, and appreciation lends to thoughtfulness and mindfulness. Knowing where your tomatoes and other foods come from can help you lose fat and be healthy.</p>
<p><b>Why food stories matter</b></p>
<p>Centuries ago, people were more connected to food. We gathered or produced much food much more individually. We knew that food grew in fields and forests, and the labor involved in cultivating that food.</p>
<p>What connection do you have to your food now?</p>
<ul type=disc>
<li >Do you raise your food?</li>
<li >Catch it?</li>
<li >Know where it comes from?</li>
<li >Know the people who produce it?</li>
</ul>
<p><b>When you're disconnected from food, it's harder to make healthy choices.</b></p>
<p>Conversely, <b>the more you know about where your food comes from and how it gets to you, the more informed and thoughtful you can be in your food choices.</b></p>
<p>You can <i>understand</i> how to buy healthy, nourishing foods.</p>
<p><b>Raise your awareness</b></p>
<p>1. <b>Look at the food around you.</b><br> Ask yourself how that food got to you. If you don't know, think about how you could find out.</p>
<p>2. <b>Consider the trip your food made to get to your kitchen.</b><br> Look in your fridge or cupboard, pick two foods, and find out where they came from.</p>
<p>Fruits and veggies usually have their place of origin right on the little sticker, or on their signs at the grocery store.</p>
<p>If you want to know more, ask your grocery store's produce manager. (That'll probably be the person carefully building pyramids out of navel oranges.)</p>
