<h1 >Veggies and fruits: Nature's medicine cabinet</h1> 
<p><strong >Veggies and fruits are nutritional powerhouses.</strong></p> 
<p><strong >They contain essential vitamins and minerals along with phytochemicals (plant chemicals) and antioxidants.</strong>&nbsp;They're the foundation of every high-quality, health-promoting diet.</p> 
<p><strong >Colorful veggies and fruits help boost your immunity and lower inflammation.</strong>&nbsp;They improve overall recovery and performance. The better you recover, the better your results.</p> 
<p><strong >The color of each veggie and fruit tells you that these crucial chemicals are present.</strong></p>

<h1 >Focus on adding, not subtracting.</h1> 
<p>The first thing most people do when starting a diet is to focus on what they can eliminate.</p> 
<p><em >&quot;I gotta get rid of X and quit eating so much Y. And no more Z!&quot;</em></p> 
<p>Logical, but also depressing and depriving. Because now, all you can think of is what you're not eating. But what if we told you to&nbsp;<strong >eat more? As in more of the right foods?</strong></p> 
<p>As in consuming an abundance of Nature's delicious and nutritious bounty?</p> 
<p>Well, that sounds much more fun. And in practice, it works a lot better</p>

<p>It's not hard to guess which foods will fill you up and give you more nutrients.</p> 
</section>
<section id="ember128" > 
<h1 >Filling up.</h1> 
<p>The body regulates appetite based in part on the volume of food.</p> 
<p>The stomach has stretch receptors that sense how much stuff is in there, and the intestinal tract knows when it's full of fiber and water.</p> 
<p>Veggies and fruits have a lot of nutrients and a lot of volume (from fiber and water), but they don't have a lot of calories.</p> 
<p><strong >When you eat more vegetables, you can eat more food, with more valuable nutrients.</strong></p> 
<p><strong >You feel fuller, healthier, more vibrant, and energetic.</strong></p> 
<p>Sweet!</p>

<h1 >Eat the rainbow.</h1> 
<p><strong >The more colors, the more nutrients.</strong></p> 
<p>So experiment with as many vegetables and fruits as possible.</p> 
<p><strong >&quot;Eat the rainbow&quot; and enjoy a wide variety of colorful veggies and fruits.</strong></p> 
<p>Here is a complete list of&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_vegetables" target="_blank" >vegetables</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_fruits" target="_blank" >fruits</a>. Have fun trying new stuff!</p> 
<p>It all counts towards your 5 servings a day.</p>
