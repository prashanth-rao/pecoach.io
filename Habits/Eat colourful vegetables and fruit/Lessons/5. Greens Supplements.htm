<p>They're packed with vitamins, minerals, and all other sorts of good stuff. They support getting leaner and healthier.</p>
<p>But what if you're in a rush? Traveling? Stuck in a surprise all-day meeting with no produce stand in sight?</p>
<p>Enter powdered greens.</p>

<h1 >Powdered greens</h1>
<p>Powdered greens are exactly what they sound like: Powders that are green. (Or, in some cases, brown.)</p>

<p> </p>
<p>Powdered greens typically contain regular and exotic fruits, veggies, sprouts, and seeds, all of which are dehydrated and puréed into powder. Greens are a micronutrient-packed, easily portable veggie-type supplement.</p>
<p>And they're perfect to eat when you're in a jam. Simply add a serving to the blender of your Super Shake. Or, if you're feeling strong, mix it with water and stir like a beast.</p>

<h1 >Greens: Supplement, not substitute</h1>
<p>A supplement is... just that—Supplemental. It's something that's <em >added</em>. It's not a full replacement for the whole food versions.</p>
<p>Eat real, whole, fresh foods whenever possible.</p>
<p>Greens supplements are best used as a back-up when you're in a pinch and don't have any whole veggies or fruits available. For example, when you're traveling.</p>

<h1 >A few tips</h1>
<ul type=disc >
<li >If you're new to using a greens supplements <strong >be sure to review the ingredient list and directions</strong>, especially if you could be allergic to anything.</li>
