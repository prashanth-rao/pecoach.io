<h1 align=center >Maintenance, and Expectations Revisited</h1> 
<h2 align=center >What should you expect for the next stage of coaching?</h2> 
<p>Coach's Notes:&nbsp;This week draws on motivational interviewing techniques to reduce resistance and improve motivation towards a new outcome. This lesson covers expectation setting and whether original expectations need to be revised.</p>

<section id="ember132" >Signs that you've entered the &quot;Maintenance&quot; stage.</h1> 
<p>If you're finding yourself wondering more often about questions like,</p> 
<p><em >What's next? What’s &quot;normal&quot;? Where should I be by now?</em>,</p> 
<p>these may be signs that you’ve entered a new phase of change: Maintenance.</p>

<h1 >1. It all comes together</h1> 
<p>At this point in your life and fitness journey, maybe you've gotten rid of some mental clutter. Maybe you've added some healthy new practices.</p> 
<p><strong >Maybe you're starting to feel the click of &quot;getting it&quot;.</strong></p> 
<p>Maybe you'll find that you can integrate coaching into your life more seamlessly. You won't have to think so much. You can just do. Healthy food choices, portions, and recipes are your default.</p>

<section id="ember135" >From other clients, that's sounded something like this...</strong></p> 
<p><em >For the first four months, I kept scratching my head and wondering HOW some people manage to transform themselves so completely.</em></p> 
<p><em >I just could not see the level of changes in myself. And then, suddenly, it had already happened. It all came together.</em></p> 
<p><em >Over time, I needed less attention and effort to do healthy practices. They started to become the &quot;norm&quot; rather than the &quot;exception&quot;. I caught myself doing them without even realizing it.</em></p>

<section id="ember137" >2. You might slow down</h1> 
<p>When making commitments to change and new practices, it's common to find that early progress is fairly quick. Then, over time, it slows down, and even seems to stall altogether.</p> 
<p><strong >Don't panic. Be patient. This is normal.</strong></p> 
<p>You can use the slower time productively.</p>

<section id="ember139" >From other clients, that’s sounded something like this...</strong></p> 
<p><em >Once I got to my goal weight, I went right back to eating whatever, whenever I wanted, and the weight came back.</em></p> 
<p><em >By learning and following one practice at a time instead, I not only changed my body, but I reprogrammed my brain into thinking like a lean person.</em></p> 
<p><em >I definitely had my ups and downs. For the first several months of coaching it seemed as if I was totally plateaued or seeing little to no results.</em></p> 
<p><em >Stick with it, find support wherever you can, and you’ll get through it.</em></p> 
<p><em >The person who sees slow and steady progress over a year will always beat out the monthly crash dieter or workout fodder.</em></p> 
<p><em >Speed of change is really less important than consistent practice. Doing something imperfectly that you do forever is better than doing something perfectly for a while, then quitting.</em></p>

<h1 >3. You might need to re-evaluate consistency</h1> 
<p>Think you’re &quot;doing everything right&quot;? Well, maybe… or&nbsp;<strong >maybe you need to do some careful, honest review of your consistency.</strong></p> 
<p>Remember, consistency gets results.</p>

<section id="ember144" >From other clients, that’s sounded something like this...</strong></p> 
<p><em >When my progress slowed a bit, I took a good look at how I was eating and tried to make sure I was really being consistent with practices, and not getting sloppy.</em></p> 
<p><em >There were several weeks when measurement day would roll around and I would look at the measurements and they were the same or &quot;worse&quot; than the previous ones, leaving me thinking &quot;WTF? How did this happen?&quot;</em></p> 
<p><em >This motivated me to examine what I had done. Was I really following the practices—and I mean really, truly in my heart?</em></p> 
<p><em >Was I really paying attention to how I was eating, or letting myself off the hook because I had a hard day?</em></p> 
<p><em >Every time I had a slow week, there was something small I found that I could improve. Something I could do to take it up a notch.</em></p>

<h1 >
<section id="ember146" >4. You might need to improve recovery</h1> 
<p>Maybe you can start looking to other areas to unlock hidden progress.</p> 
<p>Do you have a regular sleep practice? What about your protein intake? Your overall stress levels? Are you still beating yourself up with epic workouts or self-critical thoughts?</p> 
<p><strong >For example, check to see whether you need to prioritize recovery a bit more.</strong></p>

<section id="ember148" >From other clients, that’s sounded something like this...</strong></p> 
<p><em >You might start feeling burned out, especially if you’ve been pushing hard. I think I went through a bit of burnout (and possibly cockiness) which led to me thinking I was being more awesome than I really was.</em></p> 
<p><em >Sometimes, you just need a break for a day or two.</em></p> 
<p><em >In the gym, for example, it can be easy to overestimate how much to push. It’s easy to push to use more weight, and less obvious on when to focus on form, movement patterns, and mindset.</em></p> 
</section>
<section id="ember149" > 
<h1 >5. Look for other indicators of progress</h1> 
<p>The scale and tape measure might not show significant change from week to week, or even month to month.</p> 
<p><strong >If you’re consistent, you’ll still be making progress. It could be showing up somewhere you’re not looking.</strong></p> 
</section> 
<div ><span

</div> 
<p><strong >
<section id="ember151" >From other clients, that’s sounded something like this...</strong></p> 
<p><em >The way I judge my progress has changed since the beginning of coaching. I used to only go by the number on the scale. Now, I’m detached from that number. It's only ONE indicator.</em></p> 
<p><em >When evaluating my progress, now I look at my girth. I look at my body fat. I look at my strength and fitness. I evaluate my mindset, outlook, and relationships.</em></p> 
<p><em >I really look at my behaviors. Do I still hide food and sneak it? NOPE. Do I feel like a failure if the number on the scale goes up? NOPE.</em></p> 
<p><em >How’s my negative thinking? How’s my positive thinking? How’s my meal planning? How’s my meal timing? Am I really rocking in the gym and loving it? What goals have I achieved? What goals am I working on?</em></p> 
<p><em >That's the important stuff for me now.</em></p> 
<p><em >My weight loss has definitely slowed over the last couple of months, mainly because I've gotten close to my body fat goal and I am switching to building more muscle.</em></p> 
<p><em >This has been a challenging transition, because there really haven’t been any dramatic changes in my appearance to show that my habits are leading to my goals.</em></p> 
<p><em >So I find myself asking whether I'm making the right choices.</em></p> 
<p><em >I come back to the fact that I am happy with where I am and the choices I'm making.</em></p> 
<p><em >If I continue with my habits and make small changes over time, the results will come. Things don’t have to be dramatic all the time.</em></p>

<p><em >The biggest changes I have experienced can’t be captured in a photograph or measured with a scale. They happened on the inside—before I lost even a single pound.</em></p> 
<p><em >Loving life and seeking joy opened up so many options.</em></p> 
<p><em >In my journey, I learned how to truly take care of myself. Not just physically but mentally too.</em></p> 
<p><em >Daily practices helped me make a mental shift along with my physical transformation.</em></p> 
<p><em >I learned that I mattered. And that it takes hard work and true love for yourself to have a healthy self.</em></p> 
<p><em >Daily healthy practices for myself put me in a place to also help my spouse and my kids. I feel confident that I can teach my kids how to respect themselves enough to make the effort needed to be their best self. It’s not easy.</em></p>
