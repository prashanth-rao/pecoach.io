<p>Coach's Notes:&nbsp;Review of the continuum concept and how it can be applied to new goals and needs.</p>

<section id="ember125" >A little more, a little less. Rather than all or nothing.</h1> 
<p>Have you ever wondered:</p> 
<p><em >Why are some people more successful than others?</em></p> 
<p>There are a few more obvious patterns. Successful people...</p> 
<ul type=disc > 
<li ><strong >Think proactively</strong>. They anticipate, plan, strategize—and take responsibility.</li> 
<li ><strong >Break the chain of events that lead to and reinforce problem behaviors</strong>. Then they put new links in place.</li> 
<li ><strong >Use mental toughness strategies</strong>&nbsp;to stay focused, and re-focus when needed.</li> 
</ul> 
<p>There are many factors in success. Almost all of them can be learned and changed (aside from one-in-a-zillion events like being hit by lightning or winning the lottery).</p> 
<p><strong >A primary success factor: Thinking on a continuum.</strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Research on change shows that folks who struggle with change (such as changing eating habits) often have one key element in common:&nbsp;<strong >all-or-nothing thinking</strong>.</p> 
<p>In all-or-nothing thinking, the world and choices are either perfect or awful. If nobody can be perfect, all-or-nothing thinkers spend a lot of time feeling awful.</p> 
</section>
<section id="ember128" > 
<h1 >All-or-nothing thinking</h1> 
<p>Here are some examples of all-or-nothing thinking.</p> 
<p><strong >All X is good. All Y is bad.</strong></p> 
<p><em >&quot;You can't possibly get fat by eating&nbsp;</em><code ><i>____</i></code><em>.&quot;</em></p> 
<p><em >&quot;All carbs are evil.&quot;</em></p> 
<p><strong >If some is good, way more must be better.</strong></p> 
<p><em >&quot;If 1800 calories helps me lose fat, then 800—or 0—calories must be awesome.&quot;</em></p> 
<p><em >&quot;If eating vegetables is good, then I should just live on nothing but celery.&quot;</em></p> 
<p><strong >If I make a tiny mistake, everything is ruined.</strong></p> 
<p><em >&quot;Oh no! I got to bed too late last night! My recovery will be trashed!&quot;</em></p> 
<p><em >&quot;Oh no! I forgot to do my foam rolling! I've wasted my entire workout!&quot;</em></p> 
<p><strong >Any deviation from my plan—no matter how minor—is a disaster.</strong></p> 
<p><em >&quot;I have to be on a plane all day when I'm scheduled to do weights! I can feel my muscles dissolving into goo!&quot;</em></p> 
<p><em >&quot;I got called into a meeting just before lunch! Now I have to go too long without eating! I'm freaking out!&quot;</em></p> 
<p><strong >If it's not perfect, it sucks.</strong></p> 
<p><em >&quot;My squat is terrible. I can't go as far down as the video shows. Why bother?&quot;</em></p> 
<p><em >&quot;I can only do 5 (or 10, or 20) pushups. I'm a weakling.&quot;</em></p> 
<p><strong >If I make a tiny mistake, I might as well keep going, because what's the point?</strong></p> 
<p><em >&quot;I ate one cookie. Well, I might as well finish the bag now.&quot;</em></p> 
<p><em >&quot;I ate too much at Saturday breakfast. Well, I might as well just keep on over-eating for the whole weekend.&quot;</em></p> 
<p><strong >I have to completely fix everything at once… and immediately.</strong></p> 
<p><em >&quot;Today, I'm going to get up at 5 am and run, make all organic meals, quit smoking, add 10 lb to my pullups, and finally call my mother.&quot;</em></p>

<p><strong >All-or-nothing thinking is not only illogical and unrealistic, it actively harms you.</strong>&nbsp;It holds you back from making true progress.</p>

<h1 >The continuum</h1> 
<p>Nearly everything in life and coaching falls on a continuum.</p> 
<p>For example:</p> 
</section>
<section id="ember131" ><figure > 
<div class='figure'><img src='D:\PE\Procoach\Nutrition\Resource\img\10432291-502a-4980-8091-0668b6d966bb.png' width=100%></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<div class='figure'><img src='D:\PE\Procoach\Nutrition\Resource\img\49f4d094-f213-46d6-8190-4be8d82f7c12.png' width=100%></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<div class='figure'><img src='D:\PE\Procoach\Nutrition\Resource\img\b23b6f6d-ec21-4299-a102-598036923b27.png' width=100%></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<div class='figure'><img src='D:\PE\Procoach\Nutrition\Resource\img\5ecf24d7-0a1b-458d-b7e4-077b39854f7e.png' width=100%></div>
<h1 >Don’t swing… just &quot;nudge&quot;.</h1> 
<p>Sustainable body transformation, and deep health, won’t last among wild swings from extreme ends of the continuum.</p> 
<p>Rather, focus on moving one &quot;notch&quot; towards slightly better, more positive thoughts and choices.</p> 
<p><strong >Celebrate your wins, no matter how small.</strong></p> 
<p>To make it easier, you could keep a record of each day's one thing, so that you can see your progress every day.</p>
