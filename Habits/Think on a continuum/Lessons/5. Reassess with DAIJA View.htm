<h1 >The basics of self-evaluation</h1> 
<p>How do you know when practices and motivation could use a reset?</p> 
<p>Sometimes it's obvious. Maybe your weight loss has slowed down, or you've clearly been sneaking a few extra nachos.</p> 
<p>Other times, it's more puzzling. Maybe there's a funny sound in your kneecaps. Maybe it's harder to start up in the morning.</p> 
<p>Either way, the basics of self-evaluation are easy: DAIJA.</p>

<section id="ember118" > 
<h1 >1. Describe</h1> 
<p><strong >What are you experiencing? What are you doing? What are you seeing?</strong></p> 
<p>For instance:</p> 
<p><em >I have lots of energy in the mornings, but run out of steam in the afternoon.</em></p> 
<p><em >(Or, I have ninja energy all day!)</em></p> 
<p><em >My back hurts</em></p> 
<p><em >(Or, my back feels great!)</em></p> 
<p><em >I have a limited range of foods.</em></p> 
<p><em >(Or, Jamie Oliver is calling me for tips.)</em></p> 
<p>Take today to observe your daily routine, thoughts, emotions, and physical feelings like a scientist.</p> 
<p>What are you doing, thinking, feeling, and experiencing?</p> 
<p>Look at the positive stuff too. Often, you don't need to &quot;troubleshoot&quot;—you just need to find what you're&nbsp;<em >already</em>&nbsp;doing well… and help yourself do&nbsp;<em >more</em>&nbsp;of that.</p> 
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What are you experiencing that's exciting, empowering, and inspiring?</p> 
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Where are you succeeding?</p> 
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What's bringing you joy?</p> 
<p><strong >Take notes. Focus on finding as many good things as possible.</strong></p> 
</section>
<section id="ember119" > 
<h1 >2. Analyze</h1> 
<p><strong >Once you've described your current situation, look for patterns, without making any judgments just yet.</strong></p> 
<p><em >Hmm… on the afternoons when I have lots of energy, I've had less coffee in the mornings.</em></p> 
<p><em >When I get up often from my chair and walk around, my back feels better. But when I sit all day, it aches.</em></p> 
<p><em >When I look through cookbooks, I get excited about adding new foods. But when I'm busy and rushed, I feel uncreative.</em></p> 
<p>Patterns aren't always easy to find. Sometimes they don't even make any sense. That's OK—analyze anyway. You can interpret next.</p> 
</section>
<section id="ember120" > 
<h1 >3. Interpret</h1> 
<p><strong >What does this mean? What are the connections? What's the significance?</strong></p> 
<p><em >My long-term energy levels are connected to caffeine intake.</em></p> 
<p><em >My back pain is connected to my movement (or lack thereof).</em></p> 
<p><em >I'm actually quite creative—I just need inspiration!</em></p> 
<p>But interpretation isn't judgment. That comes next.</p> 
</section>
<section id="ember121" > 
<h1 >4. Judge and Act</h1> 
<p>Now that you've assembled all that insight, do something with it.</p> 
<p><strong >Decide how to move forward based on your analysis and interpretation. Then act.</strong></p> 
<p><em >One cup of coffee in the morning should be enough. Or maybe I'll even switch to green tea. Bring on the day!</em></p> 
<p><em >Movement is important for feeling good. I'm going to schedule time to move every half hour!</em></p> 
<p><em >I'll check my favorite food blog once a day. Maybe grab a copy of&nbsp;<a href="https://gourmetnutrition.com/" target="_blank" >Gourmet Nutrition</a>.</em></p>
