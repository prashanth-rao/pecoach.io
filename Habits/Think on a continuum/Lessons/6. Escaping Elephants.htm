<p>Think of an elephant.</p> 
<p>Wrinkly gray skin. Tree-stump legs. Snorty trumpet&nbsp;<em >hooowaaahh</em>&nbsp;sound.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>OK, now&nbsp;<em >don’t</em>&nbsp;think of an elephant. Seriously, stop thinking about that big, magnificent, stomping gray elephant.</p> 
<p>DO NOT THINK OF AN ELEPHANT NO MATTER WHAT.</p> 
<p>If you're like most people, that elephant is now etched into your brain like the latest, horribly catchy &quot;earworm&quot; pop song. You cant get it out, even if you try.</p> 
<p><em >Especially if you try.</em></p> 
<p>The human brain is funny. The second it's told to avoid something, it goes right for it. That can be true for thoughts, feelings, and the desire for actions.</p> 
<p><strong >The more we try to avoid thoughts, feelings, and urges we don't like, the stronger those thoughts, feelings, and urges may become.</strong></p>

<section id="ember121" > 
<h1 >The Great Escape</h1> 
<p>It's common to naturally want to avoid feeling bad. They'll do nearly anything not to feel bad. For example, trying to avoid feeling bad by... escape.</p> 
<p><strong >When we're confronted with things we don't like, we regress to simpler instincts.</strong></p> 
<p>Our thinking, planning, reflecting brain (who normally plays a mean game of chess and knows how to spell &quot;syzygy&quot;) downshifts to &quot;lizard brain&quot;, fight or flight mode. We don't want to think any more. We just want to find a place to hide and make ourselves feel better.</p> 
<p>This instinct worked great when our ancestors were escaping from a tiger. See tiger, freak out, run, hide, curl up in cave... perfect.</p> 
<p><strong >This instinct is not so helpful when it causes us to avoid dealing with things that are healthy challenges. Things that are necessary to reaching goals.</strong></p> 
<p>The paradox of escape is that&nbsp;<em >it makes things worse</em>.</p> 
<p>For example...</p> 
<p>After you've been avoiding your boss and performance review for two weeks, not only do you still have to have that performance review, you now have to explain why you've spent the last two weeks hiding in the backseat of your car in the parking lot.</p> 
<p><strong >The more you avoid the actual situation, the more you think about it.</strong></p> 
<p>The more you try to avoid thinking about the elephant, the bigger the worry of the elephant gets. Eventually, it's elephants elephants elephants.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Some psychologists argue that&nbsp;<strong >it's not our&nbsp;</strong><em ><b>actual</b></em><strong>&nbsp;problems that cause us distress—it's&nbsp;</strong><em ><b>avoiding our problems.</b></em></p> 
<p>Meaning, the coping mechanisms we choose to get away from our problems are closer to the root of what's making us unhappy.</p> 
<p>For instance, if we eat in order to avoid feeling bored at work, the eating becomes more of a problem than feeling bored was. Instead, if you'd dealt with feeling bored at work, then you wouldn't have the second problem of eating.</p>

<h1 >How are you avoiding?</h1> 
<p>Having patterns of avoiding and escaping is normal.</p> 
<p><strong >Those patterns&nbsp;</strong><em ><b>could</b></em><strong>&nbsp;be holding you back from making the best possible progress.</strong></p> 
<p>How could you be avoiding your own progress?</p> 
<ul type=disc > 
<li >Long hours at work</li> 
<li >An extra drink here and there</li> 
<li >A stash of treats in the house… &quot;because the kids like them&quot;</li> 
<li >Skipping your workouts or avoiding the bits you don't like</li> 
<li >Taking care of everyone else before yourself</li> 
</ul> 
<p><strong >The more these patterns are practiced, the bigger and more disruptive they can get.</strong></p>

<section id="ember125" > 
<h1 >Think about the elephant</h1> 
<p>Today, in order to help you do a little more, and a little better, try thinking about your elephant, whatever it is that you might be avoiding.</p> 
<p>Use your smart, thoughtful human brain (instead of your instinctive lizard brain).</p> 
<p>For instance:</p> 
<ul type=disc > 
<li >Do you really need to work late on Monday, or could you get a workout in instead?</li> 
<li >Could you have one less drink—or maybe a soda water?</li> 
<li >Could find one healthier substitute for a treat today?</li> 
<li >Could grit your teeth and do one more set, or even just one more rep, of the exercise you hate?</li> 
<li >Could just say a polite &quot;No thank you&quot; or &quot;Actually, that doesn't work for me&quot; to protect time to take care of yourself?</li> 
</ul>
