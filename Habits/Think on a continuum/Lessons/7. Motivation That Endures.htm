<p> </p>
<h1 >&quot;Discipline&quot; is a myth</h1>
<p>First, many folks argue that &quot;motivation&quot;, &quot;inspiration&quot;, or &quot;willpower&quot; aren't what truly drive us.</p>
<p>Strength coach Charles Poliquin:</p>
<p><strong ><i>There is no such thing as discipline. There is only love.</i></strong><em> Love is the most powerful creative force in the universe.</em></p>
<p><strong ><i>What do you really love? Because you are the result of what you love most.</i></strong></p>
<p><em >You either love finely etched muscular abs more than donuts or you love donuts more than washboard abs you could do your laundry on.</em></p>
<p><em >It's as simple as that. Don't beat yourself up because you have no discipline or further drown yourself in a sea of refined carbs.</em></p>
<p><em >Admit that you like this food more than you love strength.</em></p>
<p><strong ><i>One of the best ways to raise self-esteem is to make truly loving choices that lead to increased strength of body and mind.</i></strong></p>
<p><em >When you are faced with difficult choices, ask yourself: What would a loving expert recommend?</em></p>
<p><em >For example, when choosing desserts, would the loving nutritionist recommend a bowl of berries or the triple decker brownie submerged under melting vanilla ice cream?</em></p>
<p><em >When people comment on your results and say things like, &quot;Wow you have a lot of discipline&quot;, answer, &quot;No, I just make loving choices for myself.&quot;</em></p>
<p><em >Reinforcing your own positive behavior will help you grow in strength.</em></p>
<p><em >Whenever you make a truly loving choice, say to yourself, &quot;Thank you for taking care of me in a loving way.&quot; The more you talk to yourself like a loving parent, the faster you will grow.</em></p>
<p><em >Let's say, for example, you just did a single on the squat with a load you didn't feel like doing.</em></p>
<p><em >Say, &quot;Wow! I am impressed with your strength of mind! That's why you are a champion!&quot;</em></p>
<p><em >Document and reward your successes, and they will grow in magnitude and frequency.</em></p>

<section id="ember149" >Sustained motivation is a total fantasy for me.</em></p>
<p><em ><b>Every day I have to wake up and decide what it's going to be</b></em>: <em >a day of struggling or a day of rising to the occasion.</em></p>
<p><em >Once I decide, then I know what to do. Sometimes, I decide to struggle, and those days are important because I re-learn how much more uncomfortable that is than executing &quot;the grind&quot;.</em></p>

<section id="ember151" >Reach out and get support</h1>
<p><strong ><i>Never underestimate the value of reaching out to your peers or some expert resources for inspiration.</i></strong></p>
<p><em >It really doesn't take much. A small token of confidence from someone else can carry you a long way.</em></p>
<p><strong ><i>Also never underestimate the return you get from helping someone else.</i></strong></p>
<p><em >If I really just feel like I can't go on, I’ll let go of what I think I should be doing and go find a way to be focused totally on the welfare of another person. If I spend the day doing that, I'm always refueled to focus on myself by the next day.</em></p>

<section id="ember155" >I enjoy how I live each day. When you enjoy the process, you don’t have to rely so much on motivation.</i></strong></p>
<p><em >I eat foods I enjoy and do physical movement that feels good. When I live this way, the world is better off.</em></p>
<p><em >I'm more productive in my job/volunteering. I’m a better person to those around me. I feel better. I sleep better. I’m not a burden to health care. Etc.</em></p>
<p><em >I remind myself that I have it easy. I can go to the grocery store year round and get any food I want. I can go to a gym 24/7 and do any workout I want. I can turn on my faucet for a clean glass of water. I have a functional body and all the resources I need to succeed.</em></p>
<p><em >This stuff never ends. A genuine healthy living project takes a lifetime to complete.</em></p>
<p><strong ><i>No action is lost. Everything we do matters, even if there is no immediate visible result.</i></strong></p>
<p><em >A healthy and lean body is the by-product of healthy and lean living, not an end in itself.</em></p>
<p><strong ><i>A healthy and lean body is a side effect of how we live.</i></strong></p>
<p><em >Value the doing. A lean/healthy body, like most other long-term worthwhile goals, is the sum of countless small, anonymous victories.</em></p>

<p><em >Will I live in my own home? Make my own meals? Do my own banking? Or will I be dependent on others?</em></p>
<p><em >Illnesses such as Type II diabetes and metabolic syndrome are on the rise. The internal destruction these lifestyle illnesses alone can cause is far-reaching.</em></p>
<p><em >Now that I've seen this reality, the motivation to stay active long-term is easy. Though there are never guarantees in life, the best defense is a good offence.</em></p>

<p><em >Over time, you have &quot;real evidence&quot; that you are progressing... and more importantly, have the capacity to progress further.</em></p>
<p><em >Humans thrive on positive feedback. It's like our &quot;gasoline&quot;. We need to refuel constantly to keep performing well. Every time you acknowledge what you've done well, you &quot;fuel up&quot;.</em></p>

<h1 >Do just a little bit more</h1>
<p><em >Understand that sh</em><code ><i>*</i></code><em>t will happen. There will be &quot;down&quot; days.</em></p>
<p><em >On those days, become a minimalist.</em></p>
<p><strong ><i>Find the smallest thing you can do and do it.</i></strong></p>
<p><em >For example, I'll say I’m just going to foam roll and do mobility work. You'll find things will begin to snowball.</em></p>
<p><em >After that, I'll start to feel a bit better and say, &quot;I'll just do the first exercise in my program.&quot;</em></p>
<p><em >From there it may evolve into a complete workout.</em></p>
<p><em >If all you ended up doing was your &quot;smallest&quot; thing, then you still can take solace that you did something. If you did more, bonus.</em></p>

<p><em >If I'm bored with one activity, I do another. If I'm bored with one food I eat all the time, I substitute another one.</em></p>
<p><em >I also like to make up games, challenges, and experiments. I come up with new things to try (e.g., no desserts for X days, no extra food packaging for X days, bodyweight conditioning workouts for 1 month).</em></p>

<p>1. <em >You have to want it. Really want it.</em></p>
<p>2. <em >You have to be willing to work for it, knowing it will be hard and uncomfortable at times. Sometimes really hard.</em></p>
<p>3. <em >Perhaps the most important: You have to believe you can achieve it. And have strategies in place along with a support system to help continue to remind you of that.</em></p>

<h1 >The surprise motivation &quot;secret&quot;</h1>
<p>Finally, here's some straight talk on motivation and The Grind.</p>
<p><em >When it comes time to do something—like go to the gym or choose a healthy meal—people might ask themselves:</em></p>
<ul type=disc >
<li ><em >should I go to the gym today?</em></li>
<li ><em >should I eat protein and veggies now?</em></li>
</ul>
<p><em >And they think that when you're 'motivated', the answers are:</em></p>
<ul type=disc >
<li ><em >should I go to the gym today? HELL YEAH! Nothing else I'd rather do!</em></li>
<li ><em >should I eat protein and veggies now? CAN'T WAIT! Bring on the healthy food!</em></li>
</ul>
<p><em >They think motivation is a resounding positive &quot;answer&quot; to the question of whether they should do something good, valuable, necessary, etc.</em></p>
<p><em >Of course, this leads to the parallel notion that if there isn’t a resoundingly positive response, they aren't motivated.</em></p>
<p><em >And maybe they’re right and that is what motivation means.</em></p>
<p><strong ><i>The real problem lies in the fact that they think the feeling should drive their action.</i></strong></p>
<p><em >In other words, if they feel &quot;hell yes&quot; they think they should act. But if they feel &quot;hell no&quot; they think they should avoid that action.</em></p>
<p><em >That's why </em><strong ><i>&quot;motivation&quot; is crap and we need to eradicate the notion that motivation is somehow important to our actions in the world.</i></strong></p>
<p><em >Exercise and eating well is ambivalent. Some days you feel like doing it… and you do. Other days you don't feel like doing it… and you don’t.</em></p>
<p><em >But you might wonder: If I sometimes feel &quot;hell no&quot;… is there something wrong with me? Of course not. Join the club.</em></p>
<p><em >Eventually you </em><strong ><i>must learn to dissociate feeling from action.</i></strong></p>
<p><em >You must go to the gym, or eat your vegetables, even if you’re downright screaming &quot;AW HELL NO!!&quot; like Chris Rock.</em></p>
<p><em >For the first little while, this is confusing. Dissociating a long-held belief system (hell yes = go to the gym, hell no = don't go to the gym) is tough and probably feels weird.</em></p>
<p><strong ><i>&quot;Not feeling like going to the gym&quot;—or &quot;feeling like&quot; doing anything else important—is irrelevant. You just go anyway, and get started.</i></strong></p>
<p><strong ><i>Once you get started, it's amazingly easy to finish.</i></strong></p>
<p><em >And once you finish, you feel good about what you just did. And that makes it easier to go next time. And so on…</em></p>
<p><em >So, feel free to use the motivation tips in this document. They can give you a much-needed boost. But realize some important truths:</em></p>
<p><em >You won’t always feel the &quot;hell yes&quot;—in fact, you might feel that only rarely.</em></p>
<p><em >You will sometimes feel the &quot;hell no&quot;—in fact, a lot more often than you think you should.</em></p>
<p><em >If you feel &quot;hell no&quot; it’s OK—it's totally normal and nothing is wrong with you.</em></p>
<p><em >Regardless of whether you feel &quot;hell yes&quot; or &quot;hell no&quot; the only response is to go to the gym or eat the right food anyway.</em></p>
<p><strong ><i>Regardless of how you initially feel about it, starting the right action makes it easy to finish it.</i></strong></p>
<p><em >And once you overrule your &quot;hell no&quot;, it gets easier to do it the next time.</em></p>
