<section id="ember119" >Learn how to fall, and you'll learn how to fly.</h1>
<p>Every sport or activity has its version of &quot;learn to fall down&quot;.</p>
<p><strong >Falling down, screwing up, wiping out—whatever you want to call it—is inevitable whenever you take a risk.</strong></p>
<p>If you're afraid of falling, you'll never get out on that bike, or that surfboard, or on that horse. You'll never try anything, or learn anything new, or grow.</p>
<p>If you accept that falling is part of the game, learn to do it safely, and commit to getting right back up immediately, then nothing can stop you. If you embrace falling, there's nothing left to fear.</p>

<h1 >Practicing the Clean Slate Policy</h1>
<p><strong >The Clean Slate Policy:</strong></p>
<p>Whatever you did yesterday doesn't matter today. Get up, clean the slate, and move on. Practicing cleaning the slate is practicing learning to fall.</p>
<p><strong >Practicing falling means taking risks.</strong></p>
<p>It means practicing the situations that challenge you, and allowing the possibility that you might indeed screw them up.</p>
<p>If you don't do well at it the first few times, you're learning to get better at dealing with those situations when they continue to show-up in the future.</p>
</section>
<section id="ember122" >
<h1 >The risk hierarchy</h1>
<p>When it comes to eating well, doing workouts, and following healthy practices, what situations are risky for you?</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<ul type=disc >
<li >Do you struggle with holiday dinners, work parties, or dinner parties?</li>
<li >Does the schedule disruption of traveling or family demands get you off track?</li>
<li >Is it difficult for you to eat well and exercise when you're tired or busy?</li>
</ul>
<p>What are the situations that you find most challenging? It's unrealistic to try to control the situation, or avoid them entirely. Instead, how can you mentally anticipate and prepare for risky, turbulent situations?</p>
<p>How can you prepare to fall in advance?</p>
</section>
<section id="ember123" >
<h1 >Make a &quot;risk list&quot;</h1>
<p>One way: make a &quot;risk list&quot;.</p>
<p>List the situations that are more or less &quot;risky&quot; for you in terms of sticking to healthy practices.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<ul type=disc >
<li >Most risky: Holiday dinner with nutty relatives</li>
<li >Sorta risky: Lunch with coworkers</li>
<li >Least risky: Grocery shopping</li>
</ul>
<p>Start with the situations that are just <em >a little bit</em> risky.</p>
<p>Don't tackle the biggest risks just yet.</p>
</section>
<section id="ember124" >
<h1 >Visualize to prepare</h1>
<p>Visualize the future risky scene. Imagine all the things that could happen. Come up with possible solutions beforehand.</p>
<p>Have a safety net. Meaning, have something (or someone) that will cushion you, or keep you from spinning out of control.</p>
</section>
<section id="ember125" >
<div class='figure'><img src='https://prashanth-rao.github.io/pecoach.io/Resource/img/c1779823-3007-438a-a7fc-add62614cdbd.jpg' width=100%></div>
<p> </p>
<h1 >Face the fall</h1>
<p>Then, put yourself in the uncomfortable situation <em >on purpose</em>, this time with your plan in mind.</p>
<p>Observe what it feels like to be there.</p>
<p>If you fall, fall. It's OK. After all, you were prepared. Then get right back up. Immediately.</p>
<p>If you succeed, your plan worked. Now, you're stronger for having gotten yourself through. That thing is probably less scary. And, you have a reliable visualization strategy to continue working on staying upright and strong through any risky situation.</p>
<p>Over time, you can work your way up the &quot;risk hierarchy&quot; to take on bigger and bigger challenges. In the meantime, be patient with yourself. Give yourself a lot of padding and room to wipe out.</p>
