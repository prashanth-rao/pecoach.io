<h1 >A healthy environment checklist</h1> 
<p><strong >Your kitchen</strong></p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Have you eliminated junk food?</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Have you eliminated any other foods that are &quot;trigger foods&quot; for you?</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What about drinks?</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is your kitchen well-stocked with a variety of healthy foods?</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Are those healthy foods easy to get to and prepare?</p> 
<p><strong >The rest of your house</strong></p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Have you eliminated other &quot;triggers&quot; from the rest of the house? (e.g., asking people to smoke outside if you're trying to quit smoking)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Do you have other things in your house that help you be healthy? (e.g., a garden, a few dumbbells)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is your bedroom a groovy, relaxing sleep sanctuary?</p> 
<p><strong >Your daily routine</strong></p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Do you plan and prepare ways to help yourself do your practices, lessons, and workouts?</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What about rest, relaxation, and recovery activities?</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Do you anticipate and strategize around obstacles?</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Do you expect the unexpected? (e.g., running late, forgetting lunch)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Can you re-adjust your healthy practices &quot;on the fly&quot;? (e.g., ordering in restaurants, social events)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Do you have creative solutions to common problems? (e.g., cycling instead of driving to work; getting a healthy meal delivery service for times when you're busy)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Do you have and stick to a sleep ritual? What about your weekly food prep ritual?</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Do you regularly check in with motivating and inspiring images, videos, role models, reminders, or other cues?</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Does your daily routine and schedule clearly reflect your top priorities?</p> 
<p><strong >Your household and social circle</strong></p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Have you shared your health and wellness goals, needs, and expectations with the people you live with?</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What about your friends and acquaintances?</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Have you negotiated ways to ensure that you can successfully do your lessons, practices, and workouts? (e.g., shuffling child care, blocking off &quot;workout time&quot;)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Have you found like-minded people and built a support network뾵hether that's at home, at your gym, at your workplace, etc.?</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Do most of your family members and friends support you, inspire you, and help you move towards your goals?</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Have you cut down on hanging out with negative people or people who hinder your progress?</p>
