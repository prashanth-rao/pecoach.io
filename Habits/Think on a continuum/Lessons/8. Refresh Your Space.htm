<h1 >A healthy environment checklist</h1>
<p><strong >Your kitchen</strong></p>

<li> Have you eliminated any other foods that are &quot;trigger foods&quot; for you?</li>
<li> What about drinks?</li>
<li> Is your kitchen well-stocked with a variety of healthy foods?</li>
<li> Are those healthy foods easy to get to and prepare?</li>
<p><strong >The rest of your house</strong></p>
<li> Have you eliminated other &quot;triggers&quot; from the rest of the house? (e.g., asking people to smoke outside if you're trying to quit smoking)</li>
<li> Do you have other things in your house that help you be healthy? (e.g., a garden, a few dumbbells)</li>
<li> Is your bedroom a groovy, relaxing sleep sanctuary?</li>
<p><strong >Your daily routine</strong></p>
<li> Do you plan and prepare ways to help yourself do your practices, lessons, and workouts?</li>
<li> What about rest, relaxation, and recovery activities?</li>
<li> Do you anticipate and strategize around obstacles?</li>
<li> Do you expect the unexpected? (e.g., running late, forgetting lunch)</li>
<li> Can you re-adjust your healthy practices &quot;on the fly&quot;? (e.g., ordering in restaurants, social events)</li>
<li> Do you have creative solutions to common problems? (e.g., cycling instead of driving to work; getting a healthy meal delivery service for times when you're busy)</li>
<li> Do you have and stick to a sleep ritual? What about your weekly food prep ritual?</li>
<li> Do you regularly check in with motivating and inspiring images, videos, role models, reminders, or other cues?</li>
<li> Does your daily routine and schedule clearly reflect your top priorities?</li>
<p><strong >Your household and social circle</strong></p>
<li> Have you shared your health and wellness goals, needs, and expectations with the people you live with?</li>
<li> What about your friends and acquaintances?</li>
<li> Have you negotiated ways to ensure that you can successfully do your lessons, practices, and workouts? (e.g., shuffling child care, blocking off &quot;workout time&quot;)</li>
<li> Have you found like-minded people and built a support network—whether that's at home, at your gym, at your workplace, etc.?</li>
<li> Do most of your family members and friends support you, inspire you, and help you move towards your goals?</li>
<li> Have you cut down on hanging out with negative people or people who hinder your progress?</li>
