<section id="ember115" >When you're feeling stuck, it may be time for a perspective shift.</h1>
<p>There are Two Crazy Questions you can ask yourself that are the opposite of the more obvious ways to think about change.</p>
<p>These questions acknowledge that, yes, change sucks. It's uncomfortable, and there are legitimate reasons to avoid being uncomfortable.</p>
<p>Digging deeper and observing that resistance can provide great insight into what is truly motivation and challenging about the change you're facing:</p>
<p><strong >Question 1. What's GOOD about NOT changing?</strong> What are the benefits of things being the way they are now?</p>
<p><strong >Question 2. What would be BAD about changing?</strong> If you did change, what would you lose or have to give up?</p>
<p>For example,</p>

<h1 >Let's say your garage is messy...</h1>
<p>It's quite annoying to have to fight your way through old sports equipment, stacks of <em >National Geographic</em>, and holiday ornaments just to get to your car.</p>
<p>But somehow you can never motivate yourself to clean it. And it's been messy for a looong time.</p>
<p>Time for the &quot;TCQ&quot; treatment:</p>
<p><strong >Question 1. What is GOOD about NOT changing?</strong></p>
<p>Answer 1: Well, obviously, not cleaning the garage lets you avoid the work of digging through all that junk. Also, with the free time you'll save, you'll be able to do other productive things.</p>
<p>So it's easy to justify NOT changing.</p>
<p><strong >Question 2. What would be BAD about changing?</strong></p>
<p>Answer 2: The task itself sucks. Maybe you're allergic to dust. And maybe you feel like the job is big, tough, and time consuming.</p>
<p><strong >However, if you </strong><em ><b>really</b></em><strong> think about it, something else is at stake.</strong> Maybe, for instance, you think it's important to be thrifty and careful, just like your parents taught you. Throwing things out feels wasteful… even disloyal.</p>
<p>Or maybe you'd have to get rid of some things that remind you of the past. When you were younger. When your kids were younger. In essence, you'd have to decide which memories are worth keeping and which aren't. And that's hard—maybe even sad—work you'd rather put off until another day.</p>
<p>See what just happened there?</p>
<p><strong >Maybe your messy garage has nothing to do with the mess at all.</strong></p>
<p>Maybe, the resistance is actually that you don't want to make difficult decisions and part with memories. Rather than that you're lazy or a bad person.</p>
<p>By understanding deeper motivations, you get to notice and name your primary stumbling blocks.</p>
<p><strong >Paradoxically, when you become aware of what's holding you back, it's much easier to keep moving forward.</strong></p>

<h1 >Not changing in coaching</h1>
<p>In your coaching journey, &quot;not changing&quot; might mean:</p>
<ul type=disc >
<li >staying in a familiar routine</li>
<li >not &quot;rocking the boat&quot; at home</li>
<li >not wanting to feel like the &quot;health-nut weirdo&quot; among your group of friends</li>
<li >sticking with your &quot;fun-time partier&quot; or &quot;super-busy hard worker&quot; identity</li>
</ul>
<p>What might be &quot;bad&quot; about changing?</p>
<ul type=disc >
<li >You may have to change your routine.</li>
<li >You may have to confront social awkwardness.</li>
<li >You may have to find new friends… or lose the ones you have.</li>
<li >You may lose that identity… and then who will you be?</li>
</ul>

<p> </p>
<h1 >Acknowledging the trade-offs: Letting go</h1>
<p>Once you've &quot;noticed and named&quot; it's time to ask yourself:</p>
<p>1. <strong >What would I be willing to give up or lose in order to move forward?</strong></p>
<p>2. <strong >What tiny piece of the status quo could I let go of today?</strong></p>
<p>o Could you change your routine a little bit?</p>
<p>o Could you have one slightly awkward conversation with someone at home?</p>
<p>o Could you make a slightly healthier choice—discreetly—when going out with friends?</p>
<p>o Could you party a little less hard (say, have one less drink)</p>
<p>o Could you work a little bit less (say, leave the office 15 minutes earlier)?</p>
<p>You don't have to entirely revamp your life. All you have to do is move one step in the right direction. One step. Then one step. Than one step.</p>
