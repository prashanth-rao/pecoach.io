<p>If you were your own coaching client, what would you suggest?</p>
<p>1. What does my client (i.e., me) need, right now, to keep moving forward?</p>
<p>2. What's one very small task that I know my client can realistically do, today and every day for the next two weeks?</p>
</section>
<section id="ember114" >
<h1 >Keep it small</h1>
<p>You may have a lot you want to change or improve.</p>
<p>Just pick one thing.</p>
<p>And keep it small. Lasting change happens only in small steps.</p>
<p><strong >One step at a time, one practice at a time.</strong></p>
<p>These steps have to be as small as possible, so that the client (that's you) can do them every day, and feel successful.</p>
</section>
<section id="ember115" >
<h1 >Keep it simple</h1>
<p>No grand plans. No elaborate schemes.</p>
<p>This should to be something that your client (<em >aka</em> you) can realistically, for sure, do every day.</p>
<p>So keep it simple.</p>
</section>
<section id="ember116" >
<h1 >A few coaching tips</h1>
<p>1. <strong >Once you come up with the task, make it even smaller.</strong></p>
<p>You should feel ready, willing, and able to do it, with full confidence.</p>
<p>2. <strong >Do the practice you gave yourself.</strong></p>
<p>Stick with it for 2 weeks. If you notice any trouble doing the task, just make a note of it.</p>
<p>3. <strong >Help yourself remember.</strong></p>
<p>Now you're the coach to yourself. What does your client need in order to remember what to do?</p>
<p>Whatever that is, help your client do their assigned task for today.</p>
