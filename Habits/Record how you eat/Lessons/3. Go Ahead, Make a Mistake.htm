<h2 align=center >Your food journal is just a tool. It's not your self-worth. Miss-step, and track that, too.</h2> 
<p>Coach's Notes:&nbsp;Encourages clients to &quot;make mistakes&quot; on purpose, to reduce the resistance and fear of &quot;doing something bad&quot; as well as to show them how to productively deal with setbacks and treat all behaviors as simply data to be analyzed.</p>

<p>After looking through a day of eating in your food journal, you may discover some things that need improvement.</p> 
<p>Once we don our researcher's specs and look at our food journal with &quot;new eyes&quot;, we may realize that&nbsp;<strong >while we&nbsp;</strong><em ><b>know</b></em><strong>&nbsp;what to do, we may not be doing it as consistently as we need to in order to see results.</strong></p>

<p>Most people don't like feeling like they're &quot;making mistakes&quot;. We might feel embarrassed or guilty, or like we’ve failed.</p> 
<p>Which brings us to a very important point . . .</p> 
</section>
<section id="ember117" > 
<h1 >You are not your journal.</h1> 
<p>Your journal is something you do. A tool you can use. Not something you&nbsp;<em >are</em>.</p> 
<p>You own this tool. It doesn't own you. A food record is data collection, and you're the scientist.</p> 
<p><strong >The data aren’t &quot;good&quot; or &quot;bad&quot;, and neither are you.</strong></p> 
<p>Data just&nbsp;<em >is</em>.</p> 
<p>Skipped two meals yesterday? Overate to compensate? Missed your protein? Just&nbsp;<em >facts</em>. And it's totally OK.</p>

<section id="ember118" > 
<h1 >Mistakes are your friends.</h1> 
<p>When you make mistakes, you learn valuable information...</p> 
<ul type=disc > 
<li >about yourself.</li> 
<li >about specific situations in your life.</li> 
<li >about triggers and automatic patterns.</li> 
<li >about what you might need and want to change.</li> 
</ul> 
<p>Precisely&nbsp;<em >because of those mistakes</em>, you have crucial insight that you can now use to change your behavior.</p> 
<p>Cool. Thanks, mistakes!</p> 
<p>Here's a strange experiment to try, if you want to ...</p> 
</section>
<section id="ember119" > 
<h1 >Make a mistake&nbsp;<em >on purpose</em>.</h1> 
<p><strong >Go ahead. Make a mistake. Make lots.</strong></p> 
<p>Eat something &quot;bad&quot;. Make a &quot;dumb&quot; choice.</p> 
<p>Make a mistake that's familiar to you. Or make a fresh one. Your call.</p> 
<p><strong >Make that mistake. Then record it.</strong></p> 
<p>And see what happens.</p> 
<p>For example, notice and write down how your body and brain feel when you eat something that doesn't suit you.</p> 
<p>Notice how this &quot;mistake&quot; changes your future behavior. Or your cravings.</p> 
</section>
<section id="ember120" > 
<h1 >We don't learn by trying to be &quot;perfect&quot;.</h1> 
<p>Trying to be perfect could actually be making you&nbsp;<em >worse</em>.</p> 
<p><strong >Instead, we learn by letting ourselves take risks, asking questions and actively seeking improvement.</strong></p> 
<p>Why is this choice a &quot;mistake&quot; for you? Why is this a &quot;bad choice&quot; for you?</p> 
<p><strong >How can you transform the critical information from that mistake into future action?</strong></p> 
</section>
<section id="ember121" > 
<h1 >Look for bright spots too.</h1> 
<p>Making mistakes is awesome. Try it today.</p> 
<p><strong >Look for what you're doing&nbsp;</strong><em ><b>well</b></em><strong>.</strong></p> 
<ul type=disc > 
<li >What is a little easier for you now?</li> 
<li >Where are you succeeding?</li> 
<li >What's a small victory you had recently?</li> 
</ul> 
<p>How can you do more of&nbsp;<em >that</em>?</p> 
</section>
<section id="ember122" > 
<h1 >Data = your action plan.</h1> 
<p><strong >Every piece of data you collect is an opportunity to take a positive step forward.</strong></p> 
<p><strong >Every &quot;mistake&quot; is another signpost directing you along the road of your coaching journey.</strong></p> 
<p>Go on, make mistakes. Take risks.</p> 
<p>Get comfortable with &quot;screwing up&quot;.</p> 
<p><strong >&quot;Failure&quot; is just feedback</strong>—information that you can use to make a future decision better.</p> 
<p><strong >Every success shows you what to do more of</strong>, and where you're already doing well.</p> 
<p>Stay aware. Record it all. To your body, there are no secrets.</p> 
<p>Then act based on what you know to be true.</p> 
<p>Because&nbsp;<strong >that's the&nbsp;</strong><em ><b>only</b></em><strong>&nbsp;way to truly get better</strong>.</p> 
<ul type=disc > 
<li ><strong >Find what you are doing&nbsp;</strong><em ><b>right</b></em><strong>&nbsp;. . . and do more of it</strong></li> 
<li ><strong >Find what you could improve . . . face it honestly and with kindness . . . and take action as soon as possible.</strong></li>
