<h1 align=center >Bad Memories Are Good News</h1> 
<h2 align=center >Knowing more about your food intake and your eating decisions makes you more self-aware.</h2> 
<p>Coach's Notes:&nbsp;Frames recording food intake as &quot;just collecting data&quot; -- neither &quot;bad&quot; nor &quot;good&quot;, just useful information that can help clients make informed decisions about what to do next.</p> 
<form > 
<h1 >
<section id="ember109" >Pop quiz!</h1> 
<p>Get out your #2s.</p> 
<p><em ><b>What did you eat for dinner three days ago?</b></em></p> 
<p>Go ahead, write it down. We'll wait.</p> 
<p><em >Hmmm ... I think there were carrots ... and some green stuff ... maybe ... no, wait, was there an apple?</em></p> 
<p>If you're having trouble remembering, don’t worry. You still pass. You're normal.</p> 
<p><strong >Most people can't remember what they’ve eaten after only a short time, even within an hour.</strong></p> 
<p>Then, when we do recall from memory, those memories are often drastically skewed. The memories are unreliable, even if you swear they're right.</p> 
</section>
<section id="ember110" > 
<h1 >The common tendency is to&nbsp;<em >think</em>&nbsp;we eat less and move more than we&nbsp;<em >truly</em>&nbsp;do.</h1> 
<p>Research that compares people's recall of their food to what they&nbsp;<em >actually</em>&nbsp;ate shows that&nbsp;<strong >people can under-estimate their intake by up to 1000 calories a day</strong>.</p> 
<p>That's human nature. We're pretty bad remember-ers.</p> 
<p>That's why&nbsp;<strong >we don't rely on memory</strong>. We have technology. We write stuff down.</p> 
</section>
<section id="ember111" > 
<h1 >Bad memories are good news.</h1> 
<p>If you’re frustrated because &quot;nothing is working&quot;, there's good news: You might be wrong.</p> 
<p>In other words ...</p> 
<p><strong >You might simply be&nbsp;</strong><em ><b>forgetting</b></em><strong>&nbsp;some important factors. Once you become more aware, those gaps may be easy to adjust.</strong></p> 
<p>For example, let's say it feels like you hardly eat anything, but can’t lose weight. How frustrating!</p> 
<p>Then, once you record everything you eat and drink for several days, you notice things like:</p> 
<ul type=disc > 
<li >An extra glass of wine with dinner.</li> 
<li >Picking off the kids' plates as you clear the table.</li> 
<li >Your takeout coffee drink actually has 400 calories.</li> 
<li >What you think is a one-tablespoon serving of peanut butter is actually more like a quarter-cup.</li> 
</ul> 
<p>These little things add up. And, little things can be more easily changed and improved. Especially more easily than big vague nonsensical things.</p>

<section id="ember112" > 
<h1 >Awareness brings change</h1> 
<p>Knowing more about your food intake and your eating decisions makes you more self-aware.</p> 
<p><strong >More self-awareness means&nbsp;</strong><em ><b>you</b></em><strong>&nbsp;are in charge.</strong></p> 
</section>
<section id="ember113" > 
<h1 >Start with observation</h1> 
<p>At first, don't analyze, judge, or react emotionally. Just simply collect data, and observe.</p> 
<p><strong >Be unflinchingly honest and keep it real.</strong></p>
