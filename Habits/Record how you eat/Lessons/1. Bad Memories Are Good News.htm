<p>Get out your #2s.</p>
<p><em ><b>What did you eat for dinner three days ago?</b></em></p>
<p>Go ahead, write it down. We'll wait.</p>
<p><em >Hmmm ... I think there were carrots ... and some green stuff ... maybe ... no, wait, was there an apple?</em></p>
<p>If you're having trouble remembering, don’t worry. You still pass. You're normal.</p>
<p><strong >Most people can't remember what they’ve eaten after only a short time, even within an hour.</strong></p>
<p>Then, when we do recall from memory, those memories are often drastically skewed. The memories are unreliable, even if you swear they're right.</p>

<h1 >The common tendency is to <em >think</em> we eat less and move more than we <em >truly</em> do.</h1>
<p>Research that compares people's recall of their food to what they <em >actually</em> ate shows that <strong >people can under-estimate their intake by up to 1000 calories a day</strong>.</p>
<p>That's human nature. We're pretty bad remember-ers.</p>
<p>That's why <strong >we don't rely on memory</strong>. We have technology. We write stuff down.</p>

<h1 >Bad memories are good news.</h1>
<p>If you’re frustrated because &quot;nothing is working&quot;, there's good news: You might be wrong.</p>
<p>In other words ...</p>
<p><strong >You might simply be </strong><em ><b>forgetting</b></em><strong> some important factors. Once you become more aware, those gaps may be easy to adjust.</strong></p>
<p>For example, let's say it feels like you hardly eat anything, but can’t lose weight. How frustrating!</p>
<p>Then, once you record everything you eat and drink for several days, you notice things like:</p>
<ul type=disc >
<li >An extra glass of wine with dinner.</li>
<li >Picking off the kids' plates as you clear the table.</li>
<li >Your takeout coffee drink actually has 400 calories.</li>
<li >What you think is a one-tablespoon serving of peanut butter is actually more like a quarter-cup.</li>
</ul>
<p>These little things add up. And, little things can be more easily changed and improved. Especially more easily than big vague nonsensical things.</p>

<h1 >Awareness brings change</h1>
<p>Knowing more about your food intake and your eating decisions makes you more self-aware.</p>
<p><strong >More self-awareness means </strong><em ><b>you</b></em><strong> are in charge.</strong></p>
</section>
<section id="ember113" >
<h1 >Start with observation</h1>
<p>At first, don't analyze, judge, or react emotionally. Just simply collect data, and observe.</p>
<p><strong >Be unflinchingly honest and keep it real.</strong></p>
