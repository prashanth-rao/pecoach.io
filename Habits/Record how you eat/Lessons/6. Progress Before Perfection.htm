<section id="ember119" >Results come from what we do consistently.</h1>
<p>However you define &quot;progress&quot;, and whatever your goals are, you enter coaching because you want <em >something</em> to change.</p>
<p>The food journal is a tool to track how consistently you're doing the actions that lead to the results that you want.</p>
<p>Here are some questions to consider as you review your journal data.</p>
<p><strong >Question #1: Behaviors:</strong> How <em >closely</em> and <em >consistently</em> are you following your plan?</p>
<ul type=disc >
<li ><strong >Consistency</strong>: How often have you done at least part of your planned daily practice? Most days? Be as specific as possible on the number of % consistency.</li>
<li ><strong >Quality</strong>: How closely have you followed your specific daily practices?</li>
<li ><strong >Troubleshooting</strong>: If you're having trouble meeting your plan, have you worked on problem solving and/or troubleshooting to help learn more? Have you checked in with your coach whenever necessary? What patterns are you noticing?</li>
</ul>
<p><strong >Question #2: Outcomes:</strong> What's working so far?</p>
<ul type=disc >
<li ><strong >Routines</strong>: What improvements are you noticing in your everyday routine? What’s getting easier?</li>
<li ><strong >Results</strong>: How are those actions getting you results? In what ways are you feeling or performing better?</li>
</ul>

<h1 >Consistency before complaints</h1>
<p>Research has repeatedly found that, regardless of specific details,</p>
<p><strong >The &quot;best&quot; program is the one you follow regularly.</strong></p>
<p>If you consistently follow your planned program, even if &quot;imperfectly&quot;, you'll see results.</p>
<p><strong >If you want to improve your results, improve your daily behaviors.</strong></p>
<p>The cool thing is that this never has to be &quot;perfect&quot;, or even close to it.</p>
<p>Research from PN Coaching looked at 1000 people and over <em >one million</em> data points. It showed that,</p>
</section>
<section id="ember121" >
<h1 >Just putting in <em >some</em> effort—no matter how small—changes things.</h1>
<p><strong >Even clients who did daily practices only about half the time saw some results.</strong></p>
<p>Those results can add up to bigger improvements in health, mobility, and daily-life performance.</p>
</section>
<section id="ember122" >
<p><strong >According to that data, the best balance between the pull of routine habits and deliberately changing them towards new habits, seemed to be about 50-79% consistency.</strong></p>
<p>Clients who did their assigned practices about 50-79% of the time were able to make significant changes, while putting in a manageable effort and balancing their other life responsibilities.</p>
</section>
<section id="ember123" >
<p>Of course:</p>
<p><strong >The clients with the most consistency had the most significant results.</strong></p>
<p>Some were driven and determined, looking for big wins.</p>
<p>Others didn't have ambitious goals, but simply chose to prioritize their practices. They showed up every day and practiced, over and over.</p>
</section>
<section id="ember124" >
<h1 >Consistency tracking can be simple.</h1>
<p>Although the research above used some complex math, you don't have to.</p>
<p>Tracking consistency can be simple.</p>
<p><strong >1. Define what you want to observe and monitor.</strong></p>
<p>You decide what is most important to you.</p>
<p>For instance, you could use a more holistic approach of tracking whether you generally did <em >something</em> each day to move in the direction you want to go.</p>
<p>Or, you could focus on one or two targeted and specific actions.</p>
<p>It's up to you.</p>
<p><strong >Measure what's truly valuable and useful to </strong><em ><b>you</b></em><strong>, and what will get you where you want to go.</strong></p>
<p>For example:</p>
<ul type=disc >
<li ><strong >Goal</strong>: You're working on drinking more water.</li>
<li ><strong >Practice</strong>: You decide to have a glass of water at each meal or snack. You know this could help you eat a little less, which will ultimately help you lose fat.</li>
<li ><strong >Tracking</strong>: You want to focus on doing and tracking just this one item of water drinking for now.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong >2. Decide how to monitor, and track those actions.</strong></p>
<p>In the case of drinking water, maybe you decide that it's a simple yes or no a few times a day:</p>
<p><em >Did I drink a glass of water with each meal or snack?</em></p>
<p>One way to track this could be to make a little chart listing all meals and snacks, and give each meal:</p>
<ul type=disc >
<li >an X (yes, drank water), or</li>
<li >an O (no, did not drink water).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong >3. Gather some data, then assess overall consistency.</strong></p>
<p>Every time you eat, you jot down an X (yes, drank water with this meal) or an O (no, did not drink water).</p>
<p>At the end of the week, add up the Xs and divide by the total number of meals you ate.</p>
</section>
<section id="ember125" >
<div class='figure'><img src='https://prashanth-rao.github.io/pecoach.io/Resource/img/6419b3ab-b85f-42f3-99a2-23f6ccc22cb8.png' width=100%></div>
<p> </p>
<p>In this example, you can see that you drank a glass of water 28 times that week, or 78%. Good for you!</p>
<p><strong >4. Look for the &quot;bright spots&quot; and success patterns.</strong></p>
<p>78% may be a big deal if you normally drink almost no water with meals, ever. That could be a huge success!</p>
<p>As you go through your food journal, <strong >notice what works best for you, and then figure out how to do more of that</strong>.</p>
<p>Are you more successful . . .</p>
<p>. . . at certain times of day?</p>
<p>. . . in certain situations?</p>
<p>. . . with certain habits?</p>
<p><strong >Look for what is </strong><em ><b>already</b></em><strong> working well</strong>. Where you <em >already</em> feel solid and confident.</p>
<p>How could you do more of that good stuff?</p>
</section>
<section id="ember127" >
<h1 >Find the system that works for you.</h1>
<p>If doing something 90% of the time (or 80%, or 50%) seems too hard, no problem. This is your program.</p>
<p><em ><b>You</b></em><strong> get to choose what you're ready, willing, and able to do, and how often.</strong></p>
<p>Maybe life feels crazy for you right now, and 40% consistency is a victory. 40% is a huge win over 0%. Nice work.</p>
<p>Maybe you're regularly hitting 60%, but you think with some smart planning, you could get up to 70%. Go beastmode on that 10%.</p>
<p><strong >Better consistency means better results.</strong></p>
</section>
<section id="ember128" >
<h1 >Show up, and keep trying = results.</h1>
<p><strong >Take-home message #1: To make progress, you don't have to be or do anything extreme.</strong></p>
<p>You have to simply keep showing up, and doing the best in can in that moment.</p>
<p>Keep doing the few key things that <em >truly</em> matter for you, and then do them over and over and over ...</p>
<p><strong >Take-home message #2: Improving your daily choices just a little bit will probably improve your results.</strong></p>
<p>You <em >never</em> have to be &quot;perfect” or even “amazing”. Those are dreams.</p>
<p><strong >Instead, shoot for &quot;a little bit better&quot;, right now.</strong></p>
<p>Even small improvements and adjustments help.</p>
<p><strong >How could you make that happen?</strong></p>
