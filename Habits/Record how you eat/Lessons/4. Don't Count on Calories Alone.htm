<p>Coach's Notes:&nbsp;Explains why we don't use calorie counting as part of the PN approach.</p>

<section id="ember120" >Should you count calories?</h1> 
<p>In other words, should you precisely weigh, measure, and track the calories you consume?</p> 
<p>Good question.</p> 
<p><strong >First: Understanding energy balance.</strong></p> 
<p><strong >Energy balance is the relationship between energy in and energy out.</strong></p> 
<p>We bring in energy (i.e. calories) from food.</p> 
<p>We expend energy through metabolism and movement.</p> 
<ul type=disc > 
<li >When we eat less energy than we burn, we lose weight.</li> 
<li >When we eat the same energy as we burn, we maintain our weight.</li> 
<li >When we eat more energy than we burn, we gain weight.</li> 
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>No matter&nbsp;<em >what</em>&nbsp;we eat,&nbsp;<em >when</em>&nbsp;we eat it, or&nbsp;<em >how</em>&nbsp;we eat it, nothing changes that basic relationship.</p> 
<p>So:</p> 
<p><strong >Depending on your goals, you may need to be&nbsp;</strong><em ><b>conscious</b></em><strong>&nbsp;of energy balance.</strong></p> 
<p>You may need to eat more, or less, or the same, and be aware of how much that is for you.</p> 
<p>However, for most people,&nbsp;<em >conscious</em>&nbsp;doesn't necessarily mean precise calorie counting.</p> 
<p>Here's why most people don't need meticulous calorie counting, most of the time.</p> 
</section>
<section id="ember123" > 
<h1 >We can measure our energy intake in simpler ways.</h1> 
<p>For instance, we can use our hands to judge portion sizes.</p> 
</section>
<section id="ember124" ><figure > 
<div class='figure'><img src='D:\PE\Procoach\Nutrition\Resource\img\b9b7af75-cf40-4e2d-8441-9cc11cd55a07.png' width=100%></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Even advanced clients who need more precise measurements can use hand portion sizing effectively,&nbsp;<em >if they're consistent</em>.</p> 
<p>You may also be able to measure your intake using methods like dish size, or standard sizing (e.g. small, medium, etc.) at a restaurant you go to often.</p> 
<p><strong >If you don't need a more complex method, consider a simpler one.</strong></p> 
</section>
<section id="ember126" > 
<h1 >Often, counting calories can make many people feel deprived and restricted.</h1> 
<p>Most people tend to focus on what they think they&nbsp;<em >can't</em>&nbsp;do or have in terms of the numbers, rather than on nourishment, adding value, and improving food quality.</p> 
<p>As soon as the lizard brain thinks it's getting deprived, it'll want to do exactly the opposite—&quot;rebel&quot;, &quot;be bad&quot;, and &quot;break the rules&quot;.</p> 
</section>
<section id="ember127" > 
<h1 >Counting calories doesn't tell you about food&nbsp;<em >quality</em>.</h1> 
<p>You can get 2,000 calories from healthy, nutrient-rich meals spread over a day.</p> 
<p>Or you can get it from a large Frappuccino and a couple of pastries. (Which one do you think is a better choice?)</p> 
</section>
<section id="ember128" ><figure > 
<div class='figure'><img src='D:\PE\Procoach\Nutrition\Resource\img\583342d7-a634-4495-b20e-dbd1ead62350.jpg' width=100%></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<h1 >Counting calories is inaccurate.</h1> 
<p><strong >Calories are a measure of energy that doesn't account for the way our bodies digest, absorb, and use this energy.</strong></p> 
<p>For instance, 500 calories from a block of wood isn't the same to our bodies as 500 calories from a stick of butter. (Which is better, wood or butter? Self-experiment?)</p> 
<p><strong >Calorie counts on food package labels are often wrong.</strong></p> 
<p>Because of this, researchers estimate that even&nbsp;<em >meticulous calorie counting can be up to 25% off</em>.</p> 
<p>That means if you try to eat 2,000 calories, even if you do it &quot;perfectly&quot; you could be eating anywhere between 1,500 and 2,500 calories based on inaccuracies in labeling. (And, who counts calories &quot;perfectly&quot; anyway? That's not taking into account the beautiful imperfection of human eaters.)</p> 
</section>
<section id="ember130" > 
<h1 >Counting calories doesn't necessarily help us build skills or consistent daily practices.</h1> 
<p>Of course, we can certainly get into the practice of watching our portion sizes or making wise food choices.</p> 
<p>But it's much more important to focus on building strong, solid systems and strategies for execution.</p> 
<p><strong >A fit, healthy body and lifestyle come from showing up and&nbsp;</strong><em ><b>doing what matters</b></em><strong>, over and over.</strong></p> 
<p>Most people benefit more from working on ways to do&nbsp;<em >important actions consistently</em>, rather than the specific number of calories in an apple.</p> 
</section>
<section id="ember131" > 
<h1 >Awareness beats calorie counting.</h1> 
<p>You're learning to be&nbsp;<em >aware</em>&nbsp;of what food you're eating. Why you’re eating it. When you're eating. How you're eating it. How that food fuels your performance.</p> 
<p>You're learning to be&nbsp;<em >aware</em>&nbsp;of what you're thinking, doing, and feeling.</p> 
<p>Aware of your patterns, habits, and triggers. Aware of what's around you. And aware of what you're doing well.</p> 
<p><strong >If you're aware, you're in control.</strong></p> 
<p>You can carry your awareness with you wherever you go, whoever you're with, always.</p> 
</section>
<section id="ember132" > 
<h1 >And then, sometimes, calorie-counting can be &quot;calibration&quot;.</h1> 
<p>There is one way that calorie-counting&nbsp;<em >can</em>&nbsp;sometimes be useful: for calibration of your awareness.</p> 
<p>For instance, let's say you record your calorie intake for the day. And then you test that intake against your own perceptions.</p> 
<ul type=disc > 
<li >If you ate too much for your goals and what your body needs... were you aware of it?</li> 
<li >If you ate too little for your goals and what your body needs... were you aware of it?</li> 
<li >If you nailed &quot;just right&quot;, how did that feel? What physical cues told you that you got it?</li> 
</ul> 
<p>Notice what changes you could make based on the data, and what body cues you might need to tune into.</p> 
<p>For instance:</p> 
<ul type=disc > 
<li >What does a &quot;too-big&quot; meal look like? Feel like?</li> 
<li >What does a &quot;too-little&quot; meal look like? Feel like?</li> 
<li >What does a &quot;just-right&quot; meal look like? Feel like?</li> 
</ul> 
<p>Then a few days later, try calibrating your awareness against objective measurement again, and see what you discover.</p>
