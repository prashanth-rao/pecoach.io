<section id="ember120" >Should you count calories?</h1>
<p>In other words, should you precisely weigh, measure, and track the calories you consume?</p>
<p>Good question.</p>
<p><strong >First: Understanding energy balance.</strong></p>
<p><strong >Energy balance is the relationship between energy in and energy out.</strong></p>
<p>We bring in energy (i.e. calories) from food.</p>
<p>We expend energy through metabolism and movement.</p>
<ul type=disc >
<li >When we eat less energy than we burn, we lose weight.</li>
<li >When we eat the same energy as we burn, we maintain our weight.</li>
<li >When we eat more energy than we burn, we gain weight.</li>
</ul>

<div class='figure'><img src='https://prashanth-rao.github.io/pecoach.io/Resource/img/a0e159be-7dd0-4a20-bf26-cfb65aa7cd69.png' width=100%></div>
<p> </p>
<p>No matter <em >what</em> we eat, <em >when</em> we eat it, or <em >how</em> we eat it, nothing changes that basic relationship.</p>
<p>So:</p>
<p><strong >Depending on your goals, you may need to be </strong><em ><b>conscious</b></em><strong> of energy balance.</strong></p>
<p>You may need to eat more, or less, or the same, and be aware of how much that is for you.</p>
<p>However, for most people, <em >conscious</em> doesn't necessarily mean precise calorie counting.</p>
<p>Here's why most people don't need meticulous calorie counting, most of the time.</p>
</section>
<section id="ember123" >
<h1 >We can measure our energy intake in simpler ways.</h1>
<p>For instance, we can use our hands to judge portion sizes.</p>
</section>
<section id="ember124" >
<div class='figure'><img src='https://prashanth-rao.github.io/pecoach.io/Resource/img/b9b7af75-cf40-4e2d-8441-9cc11cd55a07.png' width=100%></div>
<p> </p>
<p>Even advanced clients who need more precise measurements can use hand portion sizing effectively, <em >if they're consistent</em>.</p>
<p>You may also be able to measure your intake using methods like dish size, or standard sizing (e.g. small, medium, etc.) at a restaurant you go to often.</p>
<p><strong >If you don't need a more complex method, consider a simpler one.</strong></p>
</section>
<section id="ember126" >
<h1 >Often, counting calories can make many people feel deprived and restricted.</h1>
<p>Most people tend to focus on what they think they <em >can't</em> do or have in terms of the numbers, rather than on nourishment, adding value, and improving food quality.</p>
<p>As soon as the lizard brain thinks it's getting deprived, it'll want to do exactly the opposite—&quot;rebel&quot;, &quot;be bad&quot;, and &quot;break the rules&quot;.</p>
</section>
<section id="ember127" >
<h1 >Counting calories doesn't tell you about food <em >quality</em>.</h1>
<p>You can get 2,000 calories from healthy, nutrient-rich meals spread over a day.</p>
<p>Or you can get it from a large Frappuccino and a couple of pastries. (Which one do you think is a better choice?)</p>
</section>
<section id="ember128" >
<div class='figure'><img src='https://prashanth-rao.github.io/pecoach.io/Resource/img/583342d7-a634-4495-b20e-dbd1ead62350.jpg' width=100%></div>
<p> </p>
<h1 >Counting calories is inaccurate.</h1>
<p><strong >Calories are a measure of energy that doesn't account for the way our bodies digest, absorb, and use this energy.</strong></p>
<p>For instance, 500 calories from a block of wood isn't the same to our bodies as 500 calories from a stick of butter. (Which is better, wood or butter? Self-experiment?)</p>
<p><strong >Calorie counts on food package labels are often wrong.</strong></p>
<p>Because of this, researchers estimate that even <em >meticulous calorie counting can be up to 25% off</em>.</p>
<p>That means if you try to eat 2,000 calories, even if you do it &quot;perfectly&quot; you could be eating anywhere between 1,500 and 2,500 calories based on inaccuracies in labeling. (And, who counts calories &quot;perfectly&quot; anyway? That's not taking into account the beautiful imperfection of human eaters.)</p>
</section>
<section id="ember130" >
<h1 >Counting calories doesn't necessarily help us build skills or consistent daily practices.</h1>
<p>Of course, we can certainly get into the practice of watching our portion sizes or making wise food choices.</p>
<p>But it's much more important to focus on building strong, solid systems and strategies for execution.</p>
<p><strong >A fit, healthy body and lifestyle come from showing up and </strong><em ><b>doing what matters</b></em><strong>, over and over.</strong></p>
<p>Most people benefit more from working on ways to do <em >important actions consistently</em>, rather than the specific number of calories in an apple.</p>
</section>
<section id="ember131" >
<h1 >Awareness beats calorie counting.</h1>
<p>You're learning to be <em >aware</em> of what food you're eating. Why you’re eating it. When you're eating. How you're eating it. How that food fuels your performance.</p>
<p>You're learning to be <em >aware</em> of what you're thinking, doing, and feeling.</p>
<p>Aware of your patterns, habits, and triggers. Aware of what's around you. And aware of what you're doing well.</p>
<p><strong >If you're aware, you're in control.</strong></p>
<p>You can carry your awareness with you wherever you go, whoever you're with, always.</p>
</section>
<section id="ember132" >
<h1 >And then, sometimes, calorie-counting can be &quot;calibration&quot;.</h1>
<p>There is one way that calorie-counting <em >can</em> sometimes be useful: for calibration of your awareness.</p>
<p>For instance, let's say you record your calorie intake for the day. And then you test that intake against your own perceptions.</p>
<ul type=disc >
<li >If you ate too much for your goals and what your body needs... were you aware of it?</li>
<li >If you ate too little for your goals and what your body needs... were you aware of it?</li>
<li >If you nailed &quot;just right&quot;, how did that feel? What physical cues told you that you got it?</li>
</ul>
<p>Notice what changes you could make based on the data, and what body cues you might need to tune into.</p>
<p>For instance:</p>
<ul type=disc >
<li >What does a &quot;too-big&quot; meal look like? Feel like?</li>
<li >What does a &quot;too-little&quot; meal look like? Feel like?</li>
<li >What does a &quot;just-right&quot; meal look like? Feel like?</li>
</ul>
<p>Then a few days later, try calibrating your awareness against objective measurement again, and see what you discover.</p>
