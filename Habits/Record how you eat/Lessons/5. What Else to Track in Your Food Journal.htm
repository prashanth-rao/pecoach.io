<section id="ember113" >Go beyond the basics.</h1>
<p>The core basics of food journaling are tracking:</p>
<p>1. <strong >What</strong> are you eating?</p>
<p>2. <strong >How much</strong> are you eating?</p>
<p>3. <strong >How</strong> are you eating?</p>
<p>4. <strong >When</strong> are you eating?</p>
<p>Then, maybe …</p>
<p>5. <strong >Why</strong> are you eating?</p>
<p><strong >There are even more options to track. Eating choices are complex, involving a huge range of factors from all dimensions of deep health.</strong></p>
<p>For example, variables that are,</p>
<ul type=disc >
<li >Physical</li>
<li >Emotional</li>
<li >Mental</li>
<li >Relational</li>
<li >Environmental</li>
<li >Existential</li>
</ul>

<p> </p>
<p>If it’s useful for you and your goals, try using a food journal for even deeper self-awareness, by tracking measures like,</p>
<ul type=disc >
<li ><strong >Environmental:</strong> Where are you?</li>
<li ><strong >Relational:</strong> Who are you with?</li>
<li ><strong >Physical:</strong> Are the foods you’re eating a fit for your body?</li>
</ul>
<p>These things can help you identify &quot;triggers&quot; that lead to overeating, missed meals, or streaks of awesomeness.</p>

<h1 >Where are you eating?</h1>
<p>Are you in a fancy restaurant? Eating over the kitchen sink? Sitting in your office lunchroom?</p>
<p>Which places help your healthy eating lifestyle? Which places help you slow down and pay attention? Which places don't?</p>
<p>Keeping records of <em >where</em> you eat can sometimes be as important as <em >what</em> you eat.</p>

<div class='figure'><img src='https://prashanth-rao.github.io/pecoach.io/Resource/img/081398d9-9b57-4562-a3b8-8d611b4bc283.jpg' width=100%></div>
<p> </p>
<h1 >With whom are you eating?</h1>
<p>Are you with your family? By yourself? With clients? Co-workers?</p>
<p>The people with whom you surround yourself as you eat can influence your food choices. Notice who supports your healthy practices, and who might be intentionally or unintentionally disrupting them.</p>
<p>Jotting down a note about &quot;supportive&quot; eating partners or &quot;challenging&quot; eating partners can help you decide if you really want to go to lunch with Kathy or Bob.</p>
<p><em >&quot;Every time I go out with Kathy, she criticizes me and I want to eat more, just to spite her.&quot;</em></p>
<p><em >&quot;Bob always has some great recipe tips. I'm gonna hit him up for some ideas over lunch.&quot;</em></p>
<p>Important: While they’re influential, it’s not actually Kathy or Bob to blame for eating choices. You can't control what a dining companion thinks, does, or says.</p>
<p><strong >You can only control what you think, do, or say.</strong></p>
<p>You can use challenging eating situations as a chance to practice determination for your values and goals, while being accepting of differences.</p>
<p>Practice taking care of what <em >you</em> want and need, even when the situation is challenging.</p>

<h1 >How do you feel before, during, and after?</h1>
<p><strong >Some foods may not make you feel very good physically, especially if you have a food intolerance.</strong></p>
<p>For instance, if you don't digest dairy well, you might be feeling bloated and gassy an hour after that &quot;healthy&quot; cottage cheese.</p>
<p>You might not notice these connections right away. Especially if you're rushin' being busy. It’s easy for feelings to take a back seat.</p>
<p>Good record-keeping lets you remember to be aware, spot the patterns, and eventually change them.</p>
<p><em >&quot;Hmm . . . On Tuesday I was stressed about work and then skipped two whole meals in the middle of my day. Note to self: Watch out for work triggers. And have healthy snacks on hand at work for when things get busy.&quot;</em></p>
