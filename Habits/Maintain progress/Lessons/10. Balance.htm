<section id="ember119" >How would you define &quot;balance&quot;?</h1>
<p>Does it mean &quot;everything is the same&quot;? Or &quot;my life is always perfectly level&quot;?</p>
<p>Or maybe it means <em >Everything is in its place... dynamically</em>.</p>
<p>In other words, &quot;balance&quot; isn't a static state. It's not putting things down and leaving them there, forever.</p>
<p><strong >Balance means a constant </strong><em ><b>movement</b></em><strong> and </strong><em ><b>adjustment</b></em><strong>.</strong></p>
<p>Just like maintenance.</p>

<h1 >Act balanced</h1>
<p>When you're balancing things, you move constantly, sensing the slightest shift in position.</p>
<p>For instance, stand up.</p>
<p>Now keep standing. Kinda boring, right?</p>
<p>Well, think about the engineering that has to happen for this to occur.</p>
<p>You have to balance all of you—a longish object around 5 to 6 feet tall, funny-shaped, and top-heavy (did you know your head weighs about 10-12 lb?)—on two tiny platforms.</p>
<p>Seriously, could you build anything that did this without being nailed down?</p>
<p>Now, as you stand, notice what you feel in your legs and feet.</p>
<p>Your vestibular system in your inner ears, along with your visual cortex that locks on to a reference point, senses very tiny changes in position, and sends signals down your spinal cord, into your motor nerves, telling neurons to fire in a precisely coordinated sequence.</p>
<p><strong >You're not really </strong><em ><b>standing still</b></em><strong> so much as you are constantly </strong><em ><b>negotiating a controlled sway</b></em><strong>.</strong></p>
<p>That's balance.</p>
<p>Lift one leg and stand on the other.</p>
</section>
<section id="ember122" >
<div class='figure'><img src='https://prashanth-rao.github.io/pecoach.io/Resource/img/9b8f464f-3bdd-42e2-b7c1-109a5be30bb8.jpg' width=100%></div>
<p> </p>
<p>Now you're lopsided. But you're still balanced.</p>
<p>That's balance too.</p>
<p>In this case, one thing is out of proportion to the other. Yet the overall integrity of the system remains.</p>
<p>So you stay upright. Even if you stick one leg way out to the side.</p>
<p>Eventually, if you stick one leg out too far, or lean too much, or make your body too rigid, you fall over.</p>
<p><strong >The asymmetry isn't the problem. It's </strong><em ><b>not being able to respond to change</b></em><strong> that's more of the problem.</strong></p>

<section id="ember124" >
<h1 >Walk the tightrope</h1>
<p><strong >Recognize that &quot;balance&quot; is a dynamic, continuously changing state.</strong></p>
<p>Staying balanced means staying loose, flexible, aware of your surroundings, and responsive to change.</p>
<ul type=disc >
<li ><strong >On a tightrope, if you go too rigid, you fall off.</strong> (In other words, getting too restrictive.)</li>
<li ><strong >If you lean too far in one direction, you fall off.</strong> (In other words, joining a nutrition or fitness cult.)</li>
<li ><strong >If you ask more than your body or balancing systems can deliver, you fall off.</strong> (In other words, pushing yourself too hard.)</li>
<li ><strong >If you're carrying too much, you fall off.</strong> (In other words, trying to do it all at once.)</li>
</ul>
<p>Stay aware and correct course as necessary.</p>
<p>(If you fall off, you have baselines and minimums. Clean the slate, and climb back on.)</p>
<p>Stay on the tightrope as best you can. It's fun up there.</p>

<p> </p>
<h1 >What's your balance style?</h1>
<p>Know yourself. Stay aware.</p>
<p>What's your balancing style?</p>
<ul type=disc >
<li >Do you tend to go too rigid? Then how can you loosen up and stay flexible?</li>
<li >Do you tend to lean too far in one direction? Then how can you wiggle up the middle? (Or do less?)</li>
<li >Do you tend to ask for too much from yourself and your body? Then how can you make more reasonable requests?</li>
<li >Do you carry too much baggage? Then how can you let something go today?</li>
