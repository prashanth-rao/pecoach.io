<section id="ember109" >How to come down from the high.</h1> 
<p>You know that moment after an awesome party, when everyone has left, and you're exhausted in a good way, and you start picking at the cake to calm down a bit.</p> 
<p>After a big event, like any perceived milestone, it's expected to want a break. Breaks are healthy.</p> 
<p>Give yourself a few days to celebrate, wind down, and maybe grieve this milestone a little bit.</p> 
<p><strong >It's a time for celebration and joy.</strong></p> 
<p>In those times, it can also be easy to let the wheels come off the bus, a little too much.</p> 
<p><strong >Don't let achievements be an excuse to lose healthy practices, routines, and focus.</strong></p>
