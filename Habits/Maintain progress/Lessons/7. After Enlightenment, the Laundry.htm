<p>In other words, no matter what awesome thing happened to you recently—no matter how much you hung out riding roller coasters and high-fiving Jimi Hendrix in nirvana—you're still you. You still need to deal with your everyday reality.</p> 
<p>You still need to be down to earth, doing the meaningful labor that makes this whole system work.</p>

<h1 >Welcome to the world of maintenance.</h1> 
<p>People often imagine that &quot;maintenance&quot;—i.e., staying in a place where you want to be—is tedious and boring.</p> 
<p>Or that it just suddenly happens, like a trap door opens and—plop!—you land in it.</p> 
<p>Or that it's some kind of magical destination without problems.</p> 
<p>That's probably not true.</p> 
<p>It&nbsp;<em >is</em>&nbsp;true that when you're&nbsp;<em >maintaining</em>&nbsp;daily practices, you can think less about learning new things. You can cruise and relax more.</p> 
<p>You can easily stay at a basic skill level (eating the right foods, at the right times, in the right amounts), and be quite happy and lean. You never need to &quot;progress&quot; more.</p> 
<p><strong >However, even as healthy daily practices come easier, you'll still need to support them.</strong></p> 
<p>Practices require reinforcement. Doing them every day is the most reliable way to do that.</p> 
<p>Maintenance, then, is&nbsp;<strong >a commitment to working on daily healthy practices… for life</strong>.</p> 
<ul type=disc > 
<li >To&nbsp;<em >get</em>&nbsp;lean, chop wood and carry water. (Or do your workouts and practices.)</li> 
<li >To&nbsp;<em >stay</em>&nbsp;lean, chop wood and carry water. (Or do your workouts and practices.)</li> 
</ul> 
<p>Maintenance is an ongoing journey. Every day is a new step. Even if the steps are comfortable and the road is clear... you still need to keep stepping forward.</p>
