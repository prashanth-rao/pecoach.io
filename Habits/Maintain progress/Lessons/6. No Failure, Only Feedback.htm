<h2 align=center >Replace “failure” with “information”.</h2> 
<p>Coach's Notes:&nbsp;Reviewing concept of &quot;no failure, only feedback&quot; -- how did actions lead to outcomes, and what does that tell us?</p> 
<form > 
<h1 >
<section id="ember113" >Explore and analyze your progress.</h1> 
<p>If you're ever feeling that you aren't totally happy with your progress, remember...&nbsp;<strong >all of this is a path to self-knowledge</strong>.</p> 
<p>You can ask yourself some questions:</p> 
<ul type=disc > 
<li >Do your expectations of progress match reality? How do you know?</li> 
<li >Were you doing all the behaviors that truly mattered, consistently?</li> 
<li >Could you be doing one or more of the basic practices a little bit better, or more often?</li> 
<li >Are you looking in the wrong place for progress and happiness? Where else could you look?</li> 
</ul> 
<p>If you&nbsp;<em >are</em>&nbsp;happy with something, that means you've found a strategy or mindset that&nbsp;<em >did</em>&nbsp;work for you.</p> 
<p>Both things are self-knowledge. Both things help us learn to be better in future.</p> 
<p><strong >There is no failure, only feedback.</strong></p> 
<p>Accept the feedback, learn from it, and go forward with fresh perspective.</p> 
<p>Ask yourself, &quot;<em >How's this working for me?</em>&quot;</p> 
<ul type=disc > 
<li >If the answer is &quot;<em >Fabulously</em>,&quot; then keep doing it.</li> 
<li >If the answer is &quot;<em >Not so great</em>,&quot; then use that information to change course. No big deal.</li> 
</ul>

<h1 >The sailboat</h1> 
<p>Ever seen a sailboat sail into the wind?</p> 
<p>It rarely follows a straight course. Instead, it &quot;tacks&quot; from side to side, like a zigzag.</p> 
<p>When you're sailing into the wind — i.e., having adventures and charting your new life course — you'll need to zig and zag a bit. You zig till you feel you've lost your wind, then you zag back. On average, you're going straight forward.</p> 
<p>Feedback tells you when to zig or zag. That's all.</p>
