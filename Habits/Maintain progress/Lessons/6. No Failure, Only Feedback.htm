<section id="ember113" >Explore and analyze your progress.</h1>
<p>If you're ever feeling that you aren't totally happy with your progress, remember... <strong >all of this is a path to self-knowledge</strong>.</p>
<p>You can ask yourself some questions:</p>
<ul type=disc >
<li >Do your expectations of progress match reality? How do you know?</li>
<li >Were you doing all the behaviors that truly mattered, consistently?</li>
<li >Could you be doing one or more of the basic practices a little bit better, or more often?</li>
<li >Are you looking in the wrong place for progress and happiness? Where else could you look?</li>
</ul>
<p>If you <em >are</em> happy with something, that means you've found a strategy or mindset that <em >did</em> work for you.</p>
<p>Both things are self-knowledge. Both things help us learn to be better in future.</p>
<p><strong >There is no failure, only feedback.</strong></p>
<p>Accept the feedback, learn from it, and go forward with fresh perspective.</p>
<p>Ask yourself, &quot;<em >How's this working for me?</em>&quot;</p>
<ul type=disc >
<li >If the answer is &quot;<em >Fabulously</em>,&quot; then keep doing it.</li>
<li >If the answer is &quot;<em >Not so great</em>,&quot; then use that information to change course. No big deal.</li>
</ul>

<h1 >The sailboat</h1>
<p>Ever seen a sailboat sail into the wind?</p>
<p>It rarely follows a straight course. Instead, it &quot;tacks&quot; from side to side, like a zigzag.</p>
<p>When you're sailing into the wind — i.e., having adventures and charting your new life course — you'll need to zig and zag a bit. You zig till you feel you've lost your wind, then you zag back. On average, you're going straight forward.</p>
<p>Feedback tells you when to zig or zag. That's all.</p>
