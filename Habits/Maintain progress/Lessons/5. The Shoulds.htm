<section id="ember115" >The Shoulds</em> is a horrible disease, and nobody is immune.</h1>
<p>People who have The Shoulds suffer mental and emotional torment. They may think that they...</p>
<ul type=disc >
<li ><em >should</em> run (or [insert activity here])... even if they hate it... because that's what &quot;fit people&quot; do.</li>
<li ><em >should</em> look like a fitness magazine cover... even if that image is total BS... because that's what &quot;fit people&quot; look like.</li>
<li ><em >should</em> be leaner... even if it's not right for them, or even if they have made amazing progress… because that's what &quot;fit people&quot; are.</li>
<li ><em >should</em> have worked harder… even if they did their best… because that's what some imaginary athlete is probably doing right now.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Shoulds is a nasty affliction.</p>
<p>You &quot;compare and despair&quot;. You are convinced that everyone is better, smarter, fitter, leaner, more together, etc. than you.</p>
<p>You make &quot;if-then&quot; rules about the universe such as:</p>
<ul type=disc >
<li >&quot;<em >If</em> I lose 10 (20, 50, etc.) pounds, then I <em >should</em> be happy forever.&quot;</li>
<li >&quot;<em >If</em> I have a perfect diet/training program, then I <em >should</em> have a perfect life.&quot;</li>
<li >&quot;<em >If</em> I follow coaching instructions perfectly, then all my problems <em >should</em> go away.&quot; (Well, that part is true.)</li>
</ul>
<p>There is a cure: What <em >is</em>.</p>
</section>
<section id="ember116" >
<h1 >What <em >is</em> rather than what <em >should</em> be.</h1>
<p>What <em >is</em>, is real. It's <strong >who you truly are, in all your warty, majestic, flawed and gloriously human splendor</strong>.</p>
<p>It's this magnificent moment, <em >right now</em>.</p>
<p>It's the deliciousness of imperfection that is honestly experienced.</p>
<p>It's a celebration of gratitude and awareness.</p>
<p><strong >To cure The Shoulds:</strong></p>
<ul type=disc >
<li >Take two &quot;what IS&quot; pills.</li>
<li >Drink plenty of fluids.</li>
<li >Check in to your real life.</li>
<li >Repeat daily.</li>
</ul>
