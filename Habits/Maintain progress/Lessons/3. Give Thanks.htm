<p><b>What are you grateful for?</b></p>
<p>Gratitude is an essential part of celebrating your progress. No one changes alone. We're an essential part of communities of shared gifts. Being grateful for that is what holds our place in reciprocity.</p>
<p><b>If someone specific has helped you get to where you are, take some time this week to say thank you.</b></p>

<p> </p>
<p>That could be a fit friend, a family member, a supportive spouse, the guy at the gym's front desk who is finally smiling at you instead of snarling, or your kid who snapped your progress photos along the way.</p>
<p>Maybe it wasn't a person... maybe it was a thing. Like your body who carried you through a running race. Or got stronger as you worked out. Or healed from and overcame injuries.</p>
<p>Or maybe it was your dog who was always excited to go for walks.</p>
<p><b>Recognize, respect, and reward everyone (and everything) who helped you out.</b></p>
