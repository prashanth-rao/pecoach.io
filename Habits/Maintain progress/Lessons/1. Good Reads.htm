<p><em ><b>Consumed: A Memoir</b></em></p> 
<p>Former coach&nbsp;<a href="https://www.precisionnutrition.com/meet-the-team/krista-scott-dixon" target="_blank" >Krista Scott-Dixon</a>&nbsp;wrote&nbsp;<a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18363867-consumed" target="_blank" >Consumed</a>&nbsp;based on her own experience and that of her clients. She wanted to let women know that they weren't alone in their struggles with food, eating, and self-esteem.</p> 
<p>Consumed explores with raw honesty how our relationships with others, our lives, and our selves can powerfully shape our relationship with food, the body we live in, and eating — even for so-called &quot;nutrition experts&quot;.</p> 
<p>It's available in&nbsp;<a href="https://stumptuous.com/consumed-a-memoir" target="_blank" >PDF e-book format</a>&nbsp;for easy download and... errr... consumption.</p>
