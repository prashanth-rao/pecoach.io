<section id="ember107" >Relentless optimism is the secret to long-term success.</h1> 
<p>There's a famous, highly-sought-after trainer and coach. He gets the best results of any trainer at his gym, and when asked his secret to success he says, &quot;It's simple.&quot;</p> 
<p><strong >&quot;I relentlessly point out and recognize client progress.&quot;</strong></p> 
<ul type=disc > 
<li >Client remembered a pen for their workout sheet? He'd call it out.</li> 
<li >Client had a healthy breakfast before training? High fives.</li> 
<li >Client did one more rep than last week? Yeah!</li> 
</ul> 
<p>This coach would notice and name every tiny shred of progress and success,&nbsp;<em >no matter how small</em>. That might sound like useless fluff or unnecessary sucking up to the client.</p> 
<p>There were two things that make this magical:</p> 
<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong >The coach found real things to praise.</strong>&nbsp;The client did one more rep. That's a fact.</p> 
<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong >The coach consistently focused on the good stuff and ignored the bad stuff.</strong>&nbsp;Over time, the client started behaving like a confident achiever… because the evidence told them that they were. The &quot;filter&quot; that the coach provided changed how the client felt, acted, and performed.</p> 
<p>Because of this coach's approach, the clients kicked ass.</p> 
<ul type=disc > 
<li ><strong >They thought more constructive thoughts.</strong>&nbsp;Which meant they were more mentally focused, committed, and prepared.</li> 
<li ><strong >They felt more positive feelings.</strong>&nbsp;Which meant they were consistently motivated and energized.</li> 
<li ><strong >They performed better, and made faster progress.</strong>&nbsp;Which meant they ran faster, hit harder, jumped higher, and lifted (or lost) more weight than they thought was possible.</li> 
<li ><strong >They appreciated their unique strengths more.</strong>&nbsp;Which meant they took better care of themselves. They even learned to love their bodies.</li> 
</ul>

<section id="ember108" > 
<h1 >Celebrate: It's science</h1> 
<p>Research in both coaching and neuroscience shows us that success recognition, celebration, and positive feedback works much better than self-criticism or constantly focusing on &quot;failures&quot; and &quot;mistakes&quot;, for&nbsp;<em >every</em>&nbsp;goal.</p> 
<p>This isn't just because positive feedback is inspiring (although it is). It's because&nbsp;<strong >success is the start of an action plan</strong>.</p> 
<ul type=disc > 
<li >What went well? How can you do more of that?</li> 
<li >What's already working? How can you make it work better?</li> 
<li >What tells you that you're on the right track? How can you look for more of those signs?</li> 
</ul> 
<p><strong >Recognizing our successes also makes us more creative, confident, and courageous.</strong></p> 
<p>We start to see ourselves as resilient problem-solvers rather than screw-ups. We have compassion for mistakes, and help ourselves get right back on track. We're our own best friends.</p> 
<p><strong >Celebration is more fun and inspiring than being a downer.</strong></p> 
<p>And celebration is free. You can celebrate as much as you like. Who doesn't love more fun?</p>
