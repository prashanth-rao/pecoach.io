<p>When was the last time you had a feast?</p>
<p>No, not a binge. Or an all-you-can-eat-buffet circus.</p>
<p>A <em >feast</em>.</p>
<p>A feast is a joyous celebration. A feast involves profound delight. A feast makes you happy from head to toe.</p>
<p>A feast commands the attention of all parts of you—body and mind.</p>
<p>A feast makes you thrilled to be alive.</p>
<p>Compulsive overeating, on the other hand, is <em >not</em> a feast. It's alienating and depressing, and you end up feeling awful.</p>
<p>Nor is frantic, fast-paced thrill-seeking a feast. It's frenzied, harsh and hectic.</p>
<p>After a nourishing feast you feel like a purring cat in a sunbeam: soothed and satiated, with a wonderful warm feeling about how great the world is.</p>
<p>You're fully present, basking in a tiny moment of awesomeness.</p>

<h1 >Other feasts</h1>
<p>Food is not the only object of feasts. There's also...</p>
<p>Life. Good feelings. Celebration. Joy. Play.</p>
<p>... to be feasted on.</p>
<p>Your brain is exquisitely wired up for pleasure. All those neurochemicals and neuronal connections are just hanging around, waiting for the cue to squeal with glee and get the happy machinery humming.</p>
<p>You simply need to kick-start them. Life is full of abundant opportunities to do so.</p>

<h1 >A feast for the eyes</h1>
<p>If you're a visual person, go and find something that you love looking at.</p>
<p>Maybe that's a color, an artwork, a landscape, or your child. Spend time just feasting on the beauty of that. Drink up that good-lookin' stuff until your eyeballs want to explode.</p>

<section id="ember124" >
<h1 >A feast of touch</h1>
<p>Many people are &quot;touch-fasted&quot;—starving for touch.</p>
<p>Try feasting on touch—getting a massage, dunking in a warm bath, squishing sand between your toes, going barefoot in the grass, hugging a loved one, or petting a fuzzy sweater or your cat.</p>

<p> </p>
<h1 >A feast for your ears</h1>
<p>What are your &quot;power songs&quot;?</p>
<p>The songs that make you want to yowl along like a tone-deaf cat while pretending you're a rock star? The songs that make you feel like the singer is inside your soul taking notes?</p>
<p>Put those songs on and drown your eardrums in them. Shut the door and shake your booty a little.</p>

<section id="ember127" >
<h1 >Feast on play</h1>
<p>Play is the manifestation of joy. Pure present-ness. It's a space of no-time. A space of flow.</p>
<p>Play is action without care for outcome. Go and be six years old again.</p>

<p> </p>
<h1 >Ritual feasts</h1>
<p>Rituals organize our lives. Whether that's making a traditional holiday dinner, singing &quot;Happy Birthday&quot;, or drinking coffee from our favorite mug each morning, we humans love our patterns.</p>
<p>Rituals help us mark the passing of time and make meaning from our experiences.</p>
<p>Feast on your rituals. Feel how they root you. How they stick you to your existence.</p>
